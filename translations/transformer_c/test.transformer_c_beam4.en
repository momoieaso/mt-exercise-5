Skiller years ago, here at TED, Petere Skillman introduced a challenge of design called the marshmallow.
And the idea is very simple.
Great four people have to build the most higher tower can be able to come up with alone, using 20 spaghets, a meter of tape, a tape meter of spring and a marshmallow.
The marshmallow needs to the top of the tower.
And even though it seems very simple, in fact, it's quite difficult, because it costring people to collaborate very quickly.
So I thought it was an interesting idea, and I've empowered it in a lab on design.
And it was a huge successful.
And since then, I've been organized about 70 labs of the world with students, designers and architects, even directors and architects and Fortune development companies of Fortune 50.
There's something in this exercise that's important about the nature of collaboration, and I'd like to share some of these lessons with you.
Normally, most of the people start with orient to the task.
They're talking, you imagine what it might have, they're competing for the power, then they spend time planning, organizing.
They're going to make sketches.
They're going to take most of the time disposition assembling the crop and, at the end, just when the time is scade, someone coming out the marshmallow, and they're doing a step back and Ta-!
They're working.
But what's really going on, most of the time, is that the "Ta-" turns into a" Uh-oh, "because the weight of the marshmallow does the whole structure.
There's a number of people who have more moments "uh-oh," and in the worst of other people, and in the worst of business school.
They're distracting, they're destroy, and they're creatures.
And there's of course, groups that have a lot more structures, "and, among the best, there's no childhood schools.
And it's incredible.
As Peter says, not just create the highest structures, but they're also the highest structures.
And your question is: How can it be? Why? Why is this particular?
And Peter love to say that, "No one of the kids spent time trying to become the Spahetti SpA." Right. "Right." Right. "I'm.
They don't spend time competing for power.
But there's another reason.
And the reason is that the students are formed to find the individual best project.
And then you go.
And after, what's happening is that when the marshmallow in the top, they don't have more time, and what happens?
The crisis.
It sounds familiar? Right.
So what children do differently, it's starting from the marshmallow, and they build prototypes, one after the marshmallow, have a lot of chance to fix prototypes along the walk.
The designers recognize that this kind of collaboration is the essence of iterative process.
And with every version, children have an instantaneous feedback on what works and it doesn't work.
So the ability to work on prototyping is essential, but see how they work.
The media for most people is about 50 centrimeters, for the students of the economy, about half, lawyers, a better bit, but not very, better, better than adults.
Who's better everyone?
Architects and engineers, thank you.
99 cm is the highest structure that I've ever seen.
And why? Because they understand that triangles and the geometric geometric models are the key to build stable.
And then we have the general directors, a better bit of the media.
But here's where it gets interesting.
If you include an administrator, the group can do much better.
It's amazing. It's going around, you look at "Vedrai that the group will win" You can see the ancient. "And why?
Because they've been particularly able to agevolve.
They get the process, they understand it.
And all the groups that run and pay attention to the work will improve significantly improvement of the team.
special and dots of agevolation, and their combination bringing a safe success.
If you have 10 groups that are usually working well, you'll probably have six that they're going to be able to be structures.
And I tried an interesting experiment.
I thought, let's go up for a time.
I've put 10,000 dollars in software at the wind.
What do you think that's successful students?
What was the results?
Here's what happened.
No one of the team created a stable structure.
If one of them had been built a 2.5 cm, it would take home to the premise.
Isn't it's interesting that a very strong impact?
We tried again again again the exercise with the students.
What do you think this happened?
They've understood the value of a prototype.
The same team, the worse has become the best.
They've created the higher structure in the minor.
So they're very important lessons about nature of incentives and successful. You could ask you: Why should someone spend the time writing a marshmallow?
The reason is this: help to create digital tools and processing to help groups, video games and effects.
And what a marshshmallow is to help to identify the hidden assumptions.
Because, honestly, every project has the marshmallow, isn't it?
The challenge provides a shared experience, a common language, a common position to build a prototype.
And so, this is the value of the experience, of this simple exercise.
And who of you're interested in, it can go to marshmallowing.
It's a blog where you can give a look at how to build marshmallow.
There are training.
There's crazy examples from all over the world like people's correct the system.
There's also the world record.
And the most important lesson, I think, is that design is really a sport of contact.
It requires the employment of all the senses, and the use of most final reasonments, feeling and the manufacturing that you have in hand.
And sometimes, a small prototype of this experience is everything that's necessary to turn a moment, "uh-oh," at a moment. "
And this can really make a difference.
Thank you very much.
So let's have a machine, great, great, beautiful, in the TED style, it's a time machine.
Everybody in this room have to go.
You can go back, you can't get where you're.
And I'd be curious to know what you would choose, because I asked my friends in the last time, and everybody wants to go back.
I don't know. They want to go back to before there were the car or Twitter, or "American Idol."
I don't know.
I'm convinced that there's a kind of return to the return to the eyes.
I understand it.
But I'm not part of that group, I've got to admit.
I don't want to go back, and I don't want to go back, and it's because I'm going forward.
So I want to go into the machine and I want to go on.
That's the best time that we have been on this planet in every field that we can measure: health, cheap, mobility, mobility, mobility, mobility, the rates of disease.
There's never been a period like this.
My grandparents died, everybody, before the 60 years old.
My grandparents were spent that number at 70.
My parents are to touch.
So it's better that's a nine at the beginning of my death.
But it's not just people like us, it's a much bigger than this.
A child was born in New Delhi can be able to live as much as the richer man in the world of 100 years ago.
Think about it. It's an amazing fact.
How does it be true?
It's a little bit. The pool has killed billion people on this planet.
It changed the demography of the world as no war has ever done.
If he went. I go. I go.
We've defeed it. Audience.
In the rich world, diseases that threatened millions of people just a generation is no longer exist.
His, rosolitself, polio --
someone still knows what they're?
Vaccines, modern medicine, our ability to feed billions of people, these are triumph of the scientific method.
And according to me, the scientific method, to try the things, see if they work, change when they don't work, it's one of the big results of humanity.
These were the good news.
Unfortunately, they were the only good news because there are other problems, and they've been quoted many times, for example, one of them is that, despite all that we got, a billion people goes on this planet, every day.
This number is growing, with incredible rapidity, and it's green.
And not only, we used our creativity to fix the planet.
It's a potable land, rainforests, rainforests, natural gas: they're disappearing, and they're disappearing, and if we don't see our actions to pull out of this and, we're going to be able to be able.
So the question is, can we do this? I think of.
I think it's clear that it's possible to make food to feed billions of people who live on.
I think it's possible to reprovide this world of energy without this.
I really believe it, and no, it's not an illusion.
But here's the thing I've got the night -- one of the things I'm holding the night.
We've never need to be so needed scientific progress as we need to do now, and we've never been in the position of using them as we could today.
We're an incredibly step from very incredible events, really, in many ambites.
But despite this, I think we should go back centuries, 300 years, before the Illuminism, to find a period where we've been fighting the progress, a period of time where we're doing now.
People are trapped in what they believe, and they're doing it with a lot of strength that we can't get liberate.
Even the truth can be free.
Listen, everybody has rights to their opinion; they're even going to the opinion, but you know what don't you?
You don't have your facts. I'm sorry, you can't.
I put it a little bit to understand it.
A decine years ago I wrote a story about the New Yorker vaccines for "The New Yorker, a short article.
And I was amazing that someone opposite, which was contrary to what it is, after all, the measure of public health care of all the human history.
I didn't know what to do, so I've been writing the story, and I spent another.
Not much later, I've written a story about genetically modified food.
It's just bigger.
People were impaired.
So I've written a story about that, and I couldn't understand why people consider the OGM like "food show," because they thought that moved specific molecules, rather than to go to the work of nature.
But, as always, I'm doing my job. I wrote the story and I went forward.
I mean, I'm a journalist: Let's go down, go down there.
But these stories were tortured and I couldn't understand why, but at the end of it.
The problem was that those fanatic fanats that they were doing crazy fts.
They were people of consciousness, education, people for good.
They were just like people in this room.
And the thing was very disturbing --
but then I thought, we need to be honest; we've got to be honest, on this planet, where we don't have the same relationship with the progress with with that progress that there was a time.
We're talking in a way.
We're talking in terms of ironic terms of using virgolette, "All right," OK, there's some reasons to do it, and I think we know what they are.
We've lost trust in institutions, in authority, and sometimes in the science itself, and it's understanding that it's successful.
You just do some names and people understand.
Chernobyl, the Challenger, Vioxx, weapons of mass, election elections.
I mean, each one has his list.
We have questions and problems with the people we thought we were always right.
So you're skeptical.
Do you ask the question, pretend of evidence.
You don't tell anything.
But here's the fundamental point: when the evidence is necessary, and we're not very good in this.
And I think that the reason is that we're in an epidemic that I've never seen and I've never seen.
About 12 years ago, it was published a story, a very horrible story, which was supported of autism and and vaccines against disease against disease, parods and rosoly.
Very frightening.
Hundreds of studies were made to see if it was true.
And you had to do hundreds of studies; it's an important issue.
And they finally got the data.
They came from the United States, from the England, from Sweden, from the Canada, and everybody was equal, no connection, no correlation, no correlation, nothing.
It didn't have a difference. It didn't do it because we think we're seeing, what we're going to see, what we think we're seeing, what makes us hear.
We don't believe a plant documents of the government employees showing us numbers, and I understand it, and I understand that, I think we all understand it.
But you know what?
The results were devastating --
device because this is a fact: The United States are one of the few countries in the world where the number of vaccines against the world in which the number of vaccines against the morning.
It's horrible, and we're supposed to be going to be ourselves.
It's terrible.
What's happened that's happening?
Now, I understand it. I understand it really.
Think about it, someone here has the disease?
Anyone of the audience have never seen a person died of morning?
It doesn't happen.
In this country doesn't happen, but it's 160,000 times in the world last year.
I'm a little bit of deaths, 20 every time.
But since we don't happen here, we can take it from your head, and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around and shoot messages and ignorance from palcoscenes like Oprah or Larry King Live.
And they can do it because they can't understand the difference between causality and correlation.
They don't understand that these two things seem like the same, but they're never.
But it's something we need to learn, and we need to learn to learn it quickly.
This man was a hero, Jonas Salk.
He's liberate the humanity from one of its worse.
No fear, no fear, no suffering -- the polio, puff --
The man at the center, not as well.
It's called Paul Offit.
It's just created a vaccine against the rotats together.
He's saved 400, 500 thousand children every year in developing countries.
I mean, right?
It's good, if it wasn't that Paul goes around to speak of vaccines, he says how valuable people should simply stop.
And he says in these terms.
So Paul is considered a terrorist.
When Paul: When Paul talks in a public humor can't tremendous.
They're calling it home because they like to remind them that know where his children go to school.
Why? Because Paul has created a vaccine.
I wouldn't need to tell it, but vaccines are fundamental.
If we're taking these, diseases come back, terrible diseases, and it's going on.
We've got the bills in this country.
And it's going to be worse, and we're not very much the children will commit again because it's just a question of numbers.
And they're not just going to die.
The polio? Let's get to take it. Why not?
One of my former college who wrote a couple of weeks ago, and he told me that I was considered a little bit of except.
Nobody told me before.
She wouldn't vaccinated with polio.
It's even death.
OK.
Why? Because there's no polio from us. But you know what?
We had no polio in the United States.
Today, I don't know -- maybe you're going to have a guy in Lagos and it's coming to Lagos Angeles, now it's Ohio.
Maybe it's going to land in a couple of hours, it's going to notice a machine, that's here in Long Beach and they're going to go to Long Beach and they're going to be a couple of hours,
He doesn't know that I've been infected by a paralyzing disease, and we don't even know it, because it's how the world works.
That's the planet where we live. We don't end. We're not.
We love to surrounding us. Let's do this.
Everybody took the staminkin?
Echeck, a little bit of antioxydating to start the day.
I know you did this because half of the Americans do this every day.
They take that stuff stuff, as they rate to the alternative medicine, and it doesn't matter how often they're inuseful.
The data is always demonstrates it.
They make the urinner. The more of this is not doing, almost never.
But it's okay, you want to spend 28 billion dollars per urina, I'm with you!
Urina. It's cure.
Why do we do that? Why?
I think we're looking at the big drug houses.
Let's see the great government machine. We don't trust us.
And let's do well. Our healthcare system.
It's cruel to millions of people.
It's absolutely, incredibly cold and demoralizing for those of us that can afford.
So we're scape away, and who are we going to refugee?
We're alongside of the big placebo.
It's great. We love the big placebo.
You know, it's a serious problem because this stuff is a slavor, and we spend billions of dollars.
I have a bunch of examples here.
No one of these knee kgo -- a frode, echinacea -- a frode, echinacy -- I don't know what it's, but it's a fraud.
You know what? When I say these things, people screening me against, and they say, "But what's interested in? Lascia that people do what they want.
It's good. "
You know what? You're going back.
Because I don't care if it's the secret of Department for the Service and the Service and the Service, I don't want to listen to the evidence of the thermography of the experts on mography that wants to treat the patients with the coffee.
When we imboard the street that brings to remit science and evidence with magic and tradition, we end in a place where we wouldn't want to be.
Let's start as Thabo in South Africa.
He's killed 400 mile of his concitizens continuing to say that bars were working best of the anti-retroviral drugs that we know can sdown the AIDS.
Hundreds of thousands of inuseful deaths in a nation that was more than every other than this disease.
Please, you don't tell me that there's no consequences.
There are. There are always.
Now, the most stupid epidemic that we're in the middle right now is the war's between the war's supported in the middle of the biological food.
It's an idiot. It's got to end.
It's a diatrist on the words, on the metaphor.
It's ideology, it's not science.
Every single thing we eat, every chick of rise, every chick of Brxells, every Bruxells of Brxelles was modified by the man.
You can see, they didn't have sent in the garden of Eden.
There were no melanzees.
There were not even Christmas trees. We created them.
We've done this over the last 11,000 years.
Something worked and something worked and something else.
And we've eliminated what was not working.
Now we can do it more precise.
And there are some risks, of course, there are.
But we can put things like vitamin A in the rise, and this would help millions of people, promise their life.
And we don't want to do that?
I've got to tell you, I don't understand it.
We're in the OGM.
Why?
The things that I'm always feeling: too many chemicals, pesticides, hormones, we don't want to have huge crops with the same thing, is wrong.
We don't want the company to put patents on life.
We don't want that the companies are uniquetary.
You know what's my answer to this?
It's yes. You're right. Let's.
It's true, we have a huge food problem, but it's not science.
It has nothing to do with science.
It's law, morality, morality lines.
You know that science is not a corporation.
It's not a nation.
It's not even an idea; it's a process.
It's a process, sometimes it's a process, sometimes it's the idea that we wouldn't afford science to do her only because we're afraid's been very, and it's taking a million people to try.
You know, in the next 50 years we're going to be forced to produce 70 percent of the food in more than we produce now, 70 percent.
These are the investments in Africa in the last 30 years.
Vergognose.
They need and we don't need them.
Why? His genetically modified.
We don't want to encourage people to eat feeding people like.
I've got a billion people eat it.
It looks a little bit.
But it gives it only calories. It's slave.
It doesn't have nutrients, it doesn't have protein, but scientists are found how to put it in this moment.
And so many people could eat the least the risk of becoming blind.
They wouldn't die hunger, and you know what?
It'd be very good. It's not a restaurant, but it would be very good.
I'm going to ask me, why are we against?
I mean, let's say, let's do that?
Just why don't we want to move genes and there?
It's about moving genes. It's not about chemicals.
It's not about our ridiculous obsession for hormones, or our desire to have bigger food, better.
There's no Krispies.
It's about saving people's life, and it's now that we started to understand what it is.
Because -- if we don't understand it? -- if we don't understand it, and we're going to be blaming, and we're going to be able to throw ourselves, technological colony.
There's no other way of describe what's going on.
It's selfish, it's in front of us, and we have to stop it.
So, after this conversation, you could ask me, "Do you want to go into this redier," Do you want to go into the future? "
Of course I want.
It's stuck on the present now, but we have an incredible opportunity.
We can put the machine of time as we want.
We have the chance of going where we want, and we're going to really go where we want.
We need to do these conversations, and we need to think, but when we enter the machine of time, and we're going to be happy to do it.
I know that we can and, as it's about, I think the world of it right now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
One day, the Los Angeles Times Steve Lopez was walking for for the streets of the center of Los Angeles when he heard a beautiful music.
He came from a man, a man, an African-American man, fascinating, fascinating, without dimnow, who played a violin which had only two cords.
I'm telling a story that many of you know, because the articles of the Steve serves of a book, who, who, in a book, who, in the course of the big screen, with Robert Downey Jr who interpret the part of the Steve Lopez, and Jamie Foxylist to the part of the Nathaniel Anony Ayers, the ophrenia to the Juilliard I promise career to the Juilliard to the Juillard to the Juilliard that was that I's paranded.
Nathaniel leave the Juilliard, he had a terrible exhaul, and 30 years later, 30 years later, she was living as a no roof for the streets of Skid Row in the center of Los Angeles.
I'm all of you to read the book of Steve or looking at the film to understand not just the beautiful lead that made between these two men,
My name is Jane McGonigal. I'm a game author.
I'm going to be 10 years old, and my goods for the next 10 years is to try to make easy to save the world's real as it's in the world of online games.
To do that I have a plan, and it's in me, and in convincing more people, including more time to play playing more and more beautiful and interesting.
We're three billion hours at the time we're playing online.
Some of you might think, "It's a lot of time playing."
maybe too long, looking at how many urgent problems we need to solve the real world.
In fact, in my research, at the Istitute for the Future, actually is the contrary.
Three billion hours a week are not less enough to solve the most urgent problems in the world.
In fact, I think that if we want to survive the next century on this planet, we need to increase remarkable.
I calculated that the total we need is 21 billion hours of play every week.
It's probably a counterintuitive point, so the repeat, so the repeat, to reinforce the concept.
If we want to solve that hunger, poverty, the climate change, the obesity, global conflicts, the obesity, I think we need to have the ambition to play online, for at least 21 billion hours to play online, for at least 21 billion hours to the end of the next decade. No, I'm, really serious.
That's why. This picture is a picture of reassume because I think that's so important for the survival of the species.
This is a portrait of the Phil Toldan's photographer's emotion of the game.
So she photographed the players as they were playing.
And that's a class of play.
If you're not abitual players is possible that you're losing some of this photograph.
You can probably see the sense of urgency, a little bit of fear, but also an intention to a very difficult problem.
If you're players, you'll notice some detail, you'll notice some details, and around the mouth is a sign of optimism.
And the eyebroken eyebrow show.
This is an abitual player a step from something called a "Except."
Ah, it's a term that you've heard. Okay.
So we've got abitual players between us.
A epic victory is an extraordinarily positive that you don't seem to when you don't get it as well.
It's almost over the imagination of imagination, and when you get a shock to find out what you're capable. This is an epic victory.
This player is a step from an ep-toy lives.
And that's the expression we need to see on the face of millions of resolved problems in the world as we deal with the obstacles in the world as we deal with the expression of someone who, against all the expectations, it's a step from an epm.
Unfortunately, that's the expression that we see in life of all the day while we're treating with urgent problems.
That's the expression that I call "I'm not Brate in the Reality." And I'm going to do it.
I'm not Bring expression "I'm not Bring."
This is a graffite in my old neighborhood of Berkeley, in California, where I did the PhD on why we're more good at the game in the real game.
And that's a problem of many abitual players: we feel that we're not good as well as in games.
And I don't mean "good" success "even if the success is part of this: we get more results in online worlds.
But I also mean "good" in the sense of motivate to do something important, inspiring to collaborate and cooperate.
And when we're in an online world, I think that many of us become the best versions of ourselves, the more capable of helping, more capable of focus on a problem for all the time, to get up after a failure and try again.
And in the real life, when we face a failure, when we face a failure, often we don't feel so, we don't hear so much, we feel anxious, maybe depressed or movies.
We're never feeling as we're playing.
So this is what I wanted to study to university.
What's that in a game that we can't get any results?
How can we lead those feelings and apply the real world?
So I've studied games like the World of Warcraft, which is really the ideal environment to solve collaborative.
And I started to notice some of the things that make so possible in the online worlds.
The first is that, when it appears in one of these online games, especially in the World of Warcraft, there are a lot of different characters that they're flying a mission to rescue the world. Fin from immediately.
But not any mission: a perfectly mission to your current current level in the game. Right?
So you can complete it.
They're not going to give you a challenge.
But it's the limit of your capabilities. So you've got to do it seriously.
But there's no socupation in the World of Warcraft, you don't spend the time turning around the pollic, there's always something specific and important to do.
And there's a lot of collaborators.
Whatever you're, hundreds of thousands of people, ready to join your mission.
It's not a common thing that's in real life, this feeling that we have a lot of collaborators.
And there's this narrative storm, this narrative that inspire, and what we're there, and what we're doing.
And then we get this positive feedback --
You've heard of increasing and a strength of a strength, and a intelligence.
We don't get that kind of constant feedback in real life.
When I leave this stage, I'm not going to go to a talk about front of a audience, and + 1 in ideas.
I don't get that type of feedback in real life.
Now, the problem of collaborative environments online like the World Warcraft is that it so much satisfaction is that it so much satisfying to be to a step from an epic vittory, all the moments, that we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds.
It's just better than reality.
It's for this that, until now, collectively all the players of Warcraft players spent 5.93 million years to solve Azeroth.
That's not necessarily a negative thing.
But put it in perspective: 5.93 million years ago was the time when one of our ancestors went up.
That's the first one to walk.
Okay, so when we're talking about how much time we're investing in playing, the only way even thinking about it, is to talk about it, it's about the human evolution, which is to do, but also useful, because we found that passing all this time to play, we're changing what we're, we're changing what we're, we're going to be able to collaborate and more heart.
This is true, I think.
So, you're talking about this interesting statistics.
It was recently published by a researcher at Carnagie Mellon.
The average young medium today in a country with a strong town's culture with a strong town, will have spent 10,000 hours playing online, at the age of 21.
10,000 hours is a very interesting number of times for two reasons.
First of all, for children in the United States 10.080 hours, it's the exact number of hours that I passes to school from the room to grade to the murity if you're present every day.
So we've got a whole way of parallel education in which young people learn how to be of the players ♪ ♪ I'm talking about time in school in which they learn everything.
And some of you have probably read the new book of Malcolm Gladwell, "Fuoriclasse."
If you're going to read about his theory of success, the theory of the 10,000 hours for success.
It's founded on a very good research in the cognition, which says that if we're dediculous 10,000 hours of the study that we're going to be genes in that field.
We're going to be good in that something as the best people in the world.
So what we've now now is a whole generation of young people who are the genes of the game.
So, the question is, "Exactly, what's going on."
because if we could understand what's happening we'd be disposition of human resources.
This is the number of people in the world that's at least a day to play online.
These are our game genes.
500 million people who are extraordinarily brave -- in something.
And in the next decade, we're going to have another billion.
If you already don't know it, that's what you're expected to us: the video game industry is developing platforms that the little energy network instead of the Internet to band cosystems.
And it's a billion people who are more in the next decade.
This is going to bring us to 1.5 billion players.
So I started to think about what games are transforming us into genes.
These are four aspects that I've been detected. The first is a very first.
Okay. Think of that as a form of self-motivation.
A optimism is the wish to act immediately to address an obstacle, together with the belief of having a reasonable hope of success.
The abitual players believing that an epic vittory is possible and value to be possible, and it's now, and it's now.
The abitual players don't do with hands.
The abitual players are virtuous in the tbeing a robust in social.
There's a lot of interesting research that show how we're better people after they've played with other people after playing with them, even though they've been played with them.
And the reason is that it takes a lot of trust to play with someone: we have trust that they're going to spend their time with us, who will play with the same rules and the same obbieces, and they're going up to the conclusion of the game.
So, playing together that made the lead of trust and cooperation.
We have more robust social relationships.
I love.
You know, there's a reason for the World Warcraft's player 22 hours a week, almost as a job.
It's because we know, as we're playing, that we're going to be happily, rather than relassing us or losing time.
We know that we're optimized, as a human, to work on something that has meaning.
And the abitual players are willing to work constantly, if it's assigned a task.
And to finish, a epic meaning.
The abitual players love to be associated with wonderful missions, of human stories about scale.
For example, a small information to help create context.
You're all Wikipedia, the largest wiki in the world.
The second wiki's largest wiki in the world, with almost 80,000 articles is the World of Warcraft.
They got a bunch more information on the World of Warcraft in the Internet, that on any other issue in any other wiki in the world.
They're building an epic opera.
They're building a foundation of the World of Warcraft.
Okay, these are the four superpowers that together together,
The abitual players are great super-powers.
These are people who believe they're individually able to change the world.
The only problem is they believe that they're capable to change the virtual worlds, but not that real.
That's the problem I'm trying to solve.
There's an economy called Edward Castronova.
His studies are brilliant. It's studying why people invest so much time, energy and money, in online worlds.
He says, "We're looking at the least a mass of mass towards the virtual and the environments of virtual towards the virtual and the environments of game."
And it's a economy, so it's rational, and he says -- not like me, I'm a game designer, I'm exubering --
But he says that this is a perfectly feeling that this is a perfectly sensed, because the abitual players can get more in the online worlds that in real life.
They can have more solid social relationships in a game that's not in real life.
They need a better feedback and they hear more reward in a game that doesn't live in the real life.
So, say, right now, it's perfectly reasonable for the players, to spend more time in virtual worlds that in the real world. And I agree that this is reasonable now, but it's not, a ideal situation, but it's not, a ideal situation.
So here I've got inspiration from something that's 2500 years ago.
And these are dads, facts of pecora Prime to have a joyhicks and cleaning, we had a wonderful bones of sheep. And these represents the early tools from humanity.
If you know, you know, the written of the ancient Greek, maybe you know, this story.
It's the story of who invented the games and why.
Erodot that games, particularly dadi, were invented in the worker of the Lidia, during a period of load.
It was so several of the heart was so several, that the king of the Lidia decided to do something imthinkable.
People suffered, the population was in ritime, it was a extreme, they needed an extreme solution.
So, according to Erodote, invented the games of dads and they emanded a very valid.
One day, everybody would eat.
The next day, everybody would play.
And they immersed so deeply in dade games, from the moment that play is so engaged in, and it immers in a state of justice, that ignored the fact to have nothing to eat.
And so one day they were playing, and one day.
And according to Erodoto, they spent 18 years old, surviving the heart eating one day and playing that next day and playing that next.
I think that's exactly the way we use games at the day.
We're using games to escape of the real world.
We're using games to get away from everything that doesn't work in our real environment, from all that we don't satisfy of real life, and we get what we need from games.
But we don't need to stop here.
That's really interesting: according to Erodote, after 18 years, the primary was not going to improve, and the decise that they'd played a last dadi.
They became the whole kingdom in half, they played a dadi, and the winners of that partners participate in a partner.
They'd go and they went to search of a new land where to live, and left behind the good enough of people to survive with the resources, with the hoping of their civilization from some other side, where they could could try.
It's an idea a little bit, right?
However, because of the DNA have revealed that the Etruses that they would then bring to the rohands, shared the same DNA of the old people in the Lidia.
And so recently, scientists have suggested that the story of Erodote is a real story.
And geologists have found evidence of a global cooling of a global cooling almost 20 years and that could explain the heart.
So this incredible story might be true: they could actually have been rescue of their culture playing, refugees in games for 18 years, and then be so inspired, and know as I've been so inspired, and know how to come up with the whole civilization.
Okay, we can do that even.
"Warcraft from Warcraft since 1994.
It was the first game in real time strategy of World Warcraft. This 16 years ago.
And they played for 18 years, we've played in Warcraft for 16.
I tell you, we're ready for our epics game.
They were half of the population in the journey of the world.
It's where the idea of 21 billion hours of play a week.
So let's show that half of us can agree to get an hour a day to play, until we solve the real world's problems.
I imagine what you're to ask, "How do we solve the real problems of the real world in a game?" Well, that's what I've been dedicated in my work during the last several years, present Istage.
In our offices of Palo Alto we have this express our own idea of how we should relate with the future.
We don't want to try to predict the future.
What we want to do is -- the future.
We want to imagine the scenario from the best results and then we want to give people chance to the possibility to the people to actually transform them.
We want to imagine victories and then give people the tools to make them.
I'm going to show you briefly three games that I'm an attempt to people to make the tools to create victories in their future.
This is "Petrolio."
We made this game in 2007.
It's an online game in which is trying to survive a oil.
The charity isn't real, but we've published enough material to make it online, and to make life real as if we were in the severe. So, when you go into the game. So, when you go into the game, you get there in real game, and the data that shows exactly the cost of oil, the things that's not available, the cost of the distribution of oil, the impact on the distribution of food.
the impact on the transportation, if the schools are clear, if there's rich, and you've got to think of how you're going to ask you to have a blog, to publish pictures, to publish pictures, to publish pictures...
We've had this game with 1,700 players in 2007, and we've observed them from then for the three years, and what I can say is that it's a experience that transform.
Nobody wants to change the way that they're just because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing to do.
But if they immerged them in an epic and say, "We don't have any oil.
That's an incredible story. It's an adventure that you can join!
It's yourself to see how to survive. "
Most of our players then kept the habits that learned in the game.
So, for the next game to save the world, we decided to save the world, and we decided to a larger problem of oil.
We made a game called Superstruct, at the Istitute, and the premise was: a supercomputer calculated that the humanity was only 23 years on this planet.
The supercomputer was called "Sistema Global Estination." Of course. "Of course."
We've asked people to come online almost like in a Jerry Bruckheimer's film.
You know Jerry Bruckheimer, forces a team from dream: There's a team from dream: There's apos;s an astronauty, and they all have something to do to save the world, but in our game, but in our game, instead of having only only only only only only five people in the team, all of the team from dream, and that's the future of security and the future of security, the future of previously.
8,000 people have played for eight weeks, they've generated 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can find if you go online and looking for Google "Superstruct."
And finally, the last game is going to start the three. That's a game with the three. This is a game with the World Bank.
If you're going to be certificate from the World Bank, as the Social Bank, as the Social Innovator, class of 2010.
If you work with the sub-Saharan Africa, we're inviting them to learn the techniques of social innovation.
There's a smoking story, you're increases of a level of the local knowledge, collaboration, sustainability, imagination and inventive.
I'm inviting all you to share this game with young people, everywhere in the world, particularly in the developing world, in particular areas in the developing world, which may be benefit from the way to join the world.
It's now to conclude.
I want to ask a question.
What do you think that's going to happen?
We've got all these incredible players, we have these games that are plants of what we could do, but none of these rescued rescued the real world.
Well, I hope you can agree with me that the abitual players are a human resources that we can use to do the work in the real world, that games are a powerful platform for the change, that we have these incredible superpowers, a real platform for the change, that we have these incredible superpowers, a very good robust.
I'm really hope that we can be meeting to play with games that have important, to survive on this planet for another century, and my hope is that joined me in and participate with games like this.
When I look forward at the next decade, of two things are certain: that we can make any future we can imagine, and that we can play any future we can play.
So, I say, let's start to the games that will change the world.
Thank you.
For some time, I've been interested in the placebo effect, it may seem like a weird thing that a magician if you take a magician, that's "something" fake "In other words, the gaps of this kind of thing." In other words, the pills of sugar, the effect of studies, the effect of placebo, just because the thinks the person thinks of placebo,
that what's happening is to a drug or something similar --
The therapy of the pain, for example, if you believe that they're going to have a measurable effect in the body called placebo.
Something thing about becomes true for the perception that if it's perception that if it's got.
To understand, I want to show you a wheel trick, very simple.
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick that's present in all the books for children in the 191950s.
I've learned only with Cub Scout Magic in the's years.
I'm going to execute it for you, and so I'll explain it.
And so I'm going to explain why I've explained you.
That's what happens.
The knife, you can look at.
I'm going to just the knife in my clear, so.
I'm on the manics.
It's to be safe or safe from my manics.
I'm weiring my wrist.
And so you can see that you can see something that's going to be able to do. It's going to go on or down from my manics.
And the purpose of this is simple.
I'm going to open my hand, and if everything went well, my animal magnetism will track the knife.
In fact, I'm actually going to go to the place, and the knife don't fall.
Nothing on or down from my manics.
no trick. You can look anything.
Two!
This is a trick that often often teach to children.
that they're interested in the magic, because you can learn a lot about the thodologically even though it's very simple.
Most of you're going to know this trick.
That's what's going on in my hand.
I say that I'm going up my wrist.
to make sure that nothing goes up or down from my manica, this is a lie.
The reason I'm holding the wrist is because it's the secret of illusion.
And when my hand is moving away away from you, this fingers from you, this finger here, my indetection was, in a position that, and then!
There's someone who didn't have an childhood here.
It's like this, right here, right.
And when I'm also going to go.
We can talk about why it's deception, because you don't just notice that there's just three fingers, and the way you get the information, not count, one, two.
But that's not the point. Right? And when I open my hand, Obviously remains attached not through the animal magnetism, but through the English magnetwork here.
And when I close my finger, the same thing, when I go back, this movement covers the fingers.
My hand. The knife is away.
It's a trick you can do with your friends and neighbors. Thank you.
Now, what does this with placebo effect?
I read a study, a year ago that's shown me.
I'm not a doctor or a researcher, so it was a surprising thing.
It looks like if you're a placebo in the form of a white, made like an aspirin, it's just a gun, it's a measure.
But if you change the shape and you give the placebo, in the form of a smaller pile, and you print a letter is more effective visibly.
Even if there's no drug -- they're pills.
But a white pile is not effective as a blue blue pill.
What? It really really did me.
But anyway, it's not here that end up.
The capsures are more effective of the fairly.
An the colored, which is yellow from one part and red from the other is better than a capsule.
The dosage has a role.
It's a twice twice a day is not so effective as three pills -- now I don't remember the statistics. Scuse.
But the point is --
that these dosages have a role.
And it also has a role.
And if you want the definitive placebo you have to use a needle.
Right? It's a syringe with something -- a couple of c.din..
You inject it in a patient --
This is a picture so strong in their mind, much stronger of the white of the pill.
It's real, this graph -- don't show you another time when we're on the slide.
The point is that the white pill isn't effective as the blue that's not effective as a needle.
And no one of these has a drug quality.
It's just your believe that makes them real in your own and race.
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and apply it to a magic trick.
And doing something that is a finto end and make it look like real.
And we know from the study that when you want a effect, you need to use the needle.
That's a fillon from seven pollic, a lot of them.
It's a little bit.
That's my meat. This isn't special from Damian.
This is my skin. This is not a special hollywoods.
I'm going to bucking my skin and get this.
If you try nausea -- if you get it easily -- I've done for some friends in the tree, the other night, and for some I didn't know, and a woman is almost sent.
So if you try nausea easily, suggesting you don't watch for the next 30s -- actually, you know, I'll do the first part of this.
You can see, you can look at another side.
That's what's happening here, I'm doing just a lower of my arm I just do a little hole.
Scuse. Do you impression?
And now a little bit through my skin, and out of the other side, so that.
Now, we're in the same position of the knife.
More or less, you can't get my fingers now, right?
So I'll show you. Here's one, two, four, five. Yeah, well...
I know what people think when they see.
They think, "You're going to won't be so stupid from the skin just to have a little minute."
So, let me give you a beat.
How does it look? I mean.
Yeah, I know that there's going to say, "OK, I didn't see it well."
People in rooms are entering.
So let me show you from close.
This is really my skin. It's not a special effect of Hollywood.
This is my meat, and I can turn it around.
Sorry, if you hear you look away from another side, you don't look.
People at the bottom or they're going to look at the video to say, "Well, it's clear that they're going to do,"
You can see there's a hole here and a hole here, if it was true. "
Well, now I'll get a little bit of blood.
That's here.
Normally now levers the needle.
I would give you my arm, and I'd see that there's no stop.
But I believe that in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and turn it into something of real, and I'm going to leave it into something, and I'll go from the stage.
We're going to see several times in the next days I hope that you don't see the hour. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
So in my life I met a lot of fish.
I've love two.
The first one, it was more than another of a passional story.
It was a nice heavy, prinose, it was one of the most sold on the menu.
which fish!
It's even better, there was a doten of the most elevated standard of environmental sustainability.
So, you're feeling to place with consciousness.
I was involved in a relationship with this beauty for several months.
One day, the head of the company called me and asked me to talk to me about a dedicated event to the environmental sustainability.
"Of course," I said. "
This was a company that tried to solve what came to to solve what came from an unimaginable problem for our chef.
How do we continue to have fish in our menu?
During the last 50 years, we've been fish in the mari the same way we have the forest to the soil.
The destruction was tremendous.
90 percent of the big fish, the ones that like so much the tons, the halibut, the room, the room, the fish, the fish got shades, the room, the fish got shades.
There's almost nothing.
So, it's about or not the water, the fish, the farming of fish, it's going to become part of our future.
There's a lot of topics.
The heaven fish pollutes, for the less the greater part of them, and they're inefficient, and they're inefficient. Get the tuna.
A big problem is that there's a food rate of 15 to one.
That means that we want to 15 libones to get a wildlife fish to get a libbra.
It's not very sustainable.
And that's not a great thing.
So here's finally there was a company that tried to do the right way.
I wanted to help them.
The day before the event, I've called the public of the relationship of the company.
Let's call it Don.
"Don", "I said," to understand, you're famous to do that, you're famous to do this. "
"Exactly," he said, "We're so far from the coast that our shoots are being papers, not concentrated."
And then she said, "We're basically a world."
"The conversion rate? 2.5 to a" he said. "
"The best in the sector."
2.5 to one, great.
"2.5 to one thing? What do you eat fish?"
"sustainable Proteine, he said.
"Great," I said. And I said. And I said. And I've got the phone.
That night, I was in bed, I thought, but what the hell is a sustainable?
So the day latest first of the event, I've called Don't yet.
I said, "Don, do you make some sustainable protein?"
He said he didn't know it, and he would ask.
Well, I'm talking to a little bit of people in the company and nobody had to give me precise.
And as long as I've been talking with biologist.
We also call him Don.
"Don," I said, "Do you do some example of sustainable protein?"
Well, he'll mentioned a few fish eat me, and then he said, "Believe chicken."
I said, "May of pollo?"
He said, "Yes, you know, you know, shooting, vans, varians, vans, vans, sign and eat me."
I said, "What percentage of your eat is made of pollo?"
I thought, let's say, two percent.
"Well, it's about 30 percent."
I said, "Don, what's sustainable to give the fish of the pollo to eat?"
There was a long pause on the telephone and then said, "there's too many chickens in the world."
I'm sorry about this fish.
No, because I'm not because they're one of those virtuous people and traditional and traditional.
Well, to say the truth is.
No, in fact, I'm sorry about this fish, because, I'm going to do this fish.
The second fish is a different story.
It's a romantic story that kind of story that most knows the fish and more love.
I ate it for the first time in a restaurant in the south of Spain.
One of my friend journalist had been talking about this fish.
It's basically meet.
He went to the table, he had a brilliant white color, almost scintiming.
The chef had cot too.
It's basically twice as much as it had to be cot.
Incredibly, it was still delish.
Who's capable of making a fish so good after they're doing it?
I don't, but this guy yes.
Let's call it Miguel.
It's actually called Miguel.
No, he didn't have the fish, and it's not a chef.
For the least, not in the sense that we're going to usually.
It's a biologist in Veta Palma that's a training fish in the Western corner of the Spain in the War 'river's's Palquivir.
Under the 1980s, the heavy of the 1980s.
They had belonges on what they used to have been essentially a paludosa.
And they had drinking the ground building a series of channels that they wanted to the water in the river.
Well, they couldn't make it work out of the economic point of view.
And, from the point of view, it was a disaster.
He had killed something like 90 percent of birds and, looking at the place, it's a lot of birds.
So, in 1982, an except company with an environmental consciousness.
What do they do?
They're going to start the stream.
literally, they're lying the switch.
Instead of trying to meet the water away from the ground, they used channels to put it.
They're all the channels.
They grew up with 27 mile spigle, shrimp shots, angue and in this process, Miguel and in this process, Miguel and this company and the invertiring completely the ecological destruction.
It's incredible.
I mean, it's never seen something like this.
Look at the horizon that it seems to be away from a million miles and everything that you see is the same one million miles, and this rich money.
I've been there recently with Miguel.
It's an incredible type three quarters Darwin and a fourth Crocodile Dundee.
Okay? We're doing it in the middle of this lagon and I had the sneakes, I had the fango to the knees and Miguel, calculated his lesson of biology.
I'm looking at a weight black.
And then he explains the mineral necessity of the planoplankton, and then see a kind of fish of fish that reminds him of Tanzania.
And outside Miguel has spent a lot of his career at the National Park Mikumi in Africa.
I asked him how it had become a fish expert.
He said, "Pesci? I know nothing fish.
I'm an expert in relationships. "
And it's still in the speech on the rarians, algae and strange plants.
I don't get me wrong, all this was very fascinating, which is, a thing like the biotics community community.
It's interesting, but I was in love.
And my head kept to rethink of that delish fish that I'd eat the night before.
So the interrupp and I said, "Miguel, what makes your fish so good?"
He indicated the algae.
"I know, the algae, the fitplankton, the relationships, yes, the relationships, yes, it's incredible.
But your fish fish fish are eating?
What's your food conversion of conversion?
Well, they responds to me telling me about how their own is so rich system that the fish eat exactly what they'd sending in a wild environment.
The plant biomass, the plankton, the zooplankton, is all the fish.
The system is so that it's completely self-renova.
There's no eat me.
Did you've ever heard about a training training that we don't eat his animals?
And then later, I was driving around the ground with Miguel and said, "In a place like this soil that looks so natural as it looks like this natural as you do?"
At that precise moment, it was like if the regist of a film had ordinary change the change of set.
We got the angle and see a scene between the most incredible thousands and thousands of rose thousands of red fenicothers and thousands of red fends a real rose that was lost to eye.
"That's the success, he said.
"Look at their pance, they're red.
They're planning. "
Banching? I was completely confused.
I said, "Miguel, but are don't they're bought to your fish?"
"Yes," he said. "
"Let's about 20 percent of the fish and the eggs of the birds.
Last year on this properties there were 600,000 birds.
Today it's become the largest and one of the most important private healthcare for birds in Europe. "
I said, "Miguel, but a population of bird is not the last thing you want in a fish that you would like in a fish alevent?"
He knows her head, no.
He said, "We're going to extend.
This is a ecological network.
The fends eat eat the legs.
Tribers eatoplankton.
So, it's rose the trust of the fenifly better is the system. "
Okay, then then we're going to be able to eat his animals and measurement its success in the basic health of its predators.
It's a fish training, but also a healthcare for birds.
Ah, by the way, those faces would not even have to be there.
They do the nest in a town 150 miles where the conditions are better for the building of nest.
Every morning, they're flying for 150 miles, and they get to 150 miles for the back.
They're doing it because they're capable of following the A92.
On the night.
I would imagine something like penguins so I looked at Miguel.
And I said, "Miguel, they fly fly for 150 miles at night and then 150 miles to go back?
Do they do it for them? "
It looked at me as if I had just mentioned a song of Whitney Houston.
He said, "No, they do it because food is better."
I didn't talk about the skin of my fish that was delizious, and I usually don't like the skin of the fish.
I don't like abbrustolita, I don't like crash.
It's that soap, as asphase.
Don't almost ever cook.
However, when I hike it in that south of the south of the Spain of the Spain.
He had a sweet knows and clean was like to give a dead sor to the ocean.
I said this in Miguel, and he annoyed.
He said, "The skin is as a waste.
It's the last defense before all of the fish in the body of the fish.
It's evolved to deal. "
And then she said, "But our water doesn't have unit."
Okay. It's a training fish.
It's a very successful thing about his predators.
And then I realize that when he says that the heaven doesn't have a lot of minimizing it very much the thing because the water that flows in that heaven with itself is all the things that the river with itself is all the things that the rivers tend with the chemical pesticide.
And when it's going to go through the system and it's more clear than when it's gone.
The system is so healthcare, which is the water.
So, not just a alevation that doesn't just feeding his animals not only an alevation of its predators, but a very, which is literally a plant plant of water and not only for those fish but also for me and for you.
Because when the water goes into the Atlantic.
It's a drop in the ocean, I know, but I do the welcome, and so you would do even because this story of love as romantic as romantic is also instructive.
You might say that it's a recipe for the future of good food is that you're talking about fish.
What we now need is a radically new conception of agriculture in which the food really really really good.
But for many people, this is a little bit too radical.
We're not realists, we're passionate about food.
We're love.
Let's addressing small farmers.
Let's move the small family faces.
Let's talk about local territory food.
Let's look at the biological.
And when you tell those are the things that will make sure the future of good food, somewhere, and they say, "Hey you're," Hey, even to me, the fenicopters, but how do you can feed the whole world?
How do you think we can feed the world? "
Can I be max?
It's a question I don't like.
No, because we're already producing even more than we can feed the world.
One billion people suffer the hunger today.
There's a billion -- more than we've ever been -- because of huge inequality in the distribution.
You see, I don't like this question, because it has determined the logic of our food system in the last 50 years.
Dare cereals to the pesticide's monocultures, chemicals, chemicals and all this time the agricultures and all this time the agricultures, just asked, "What is we do?"
This was motivation.
It was the justification.
It was the American agriculture business plan.
We'd have to call it for what's, a liquidation industry that's just quickly heroding capital that makes the same production possible.
This is not an industry, and it's not agriculture.
Our panist today is threatened not because of providing providing the sea, but for the resources in diminution, not for the last mechanics, but for the freshing mechanics, but for the fresh water, not for the sea, but for the rights and not to the fish and the fishereces and the rights, but for the fish and not the fish and the fish, but for the fish in the sea.
Do you want to feed the world?
So let's start asking us, how are we going to feed ourselves?
Or, how can we create the conditions that condition to the local communities to feed itself?
To do that, we don't look at the agricultural model of the future.
It's an old and tired model.
It's all about capital, chemistry and machinery, and he's never really product of good eat.
Instead, we look at the ecological model.
It's what's about two billion years of work.
Let's look at Miguel, to alevators like Miguel to farm and farm that are not claim in one of closed if they're going to be able to consume to the farm that crops to grow, but experiments, because they're the experiments, because they're the experts, because they're the kind of experiment.
If I have to be really better than they're chef than I've ever been.
You know, it's okay, because if that's going to be good food.
Thank you.
I grew up with a foundation of science fiction.
I'd have to have a school now, a hour back and back every day.
And I was always immersed in a book, a science science science fiction, which was leading my minds in other worlds, and satisfied, in the narrative of curiosity that I had.
And that curiosity was also manifest in the fact that every time I wasn't in school, I was out in the boots, and snakes, insects and snakes, insects and ties and stagnants, bringing them home to the microscope.
I was a real geek of science.
But it was always trying to figure out the world, understand the limits of possible.
And my love for the science fiction actually seemed to reflect the world around me, because what was happening, in the 1960s, we were going to go to the moon, and we explore the depth of the oceans, Jacquacques Cousteau went to our room with his fantastic documentary documentaries that showed us animals and showing us, and a wonderful world that showing us,
So, it seemed to reinforce my passion for science fiction.
And I was an artist.
I knew draw. I knew I had paint.
And because there were no video games, and this display, nor all of these images in the middle of the middle of the media, I had to create these images in my head.
As children, as we used to read a book, we all had to, through the description of the author, put something on the screen of our heads.
And so, my answer was painting, draw creatures alien creatures, aliens, robots, spacecraft, all this stuff.
The lectures of mathematics were always beeting behind the text book.
That's because creativity had to find a way out.
And that's interesting: the Jacques Cousteau's programs me that there was a world right here.
Maybe I'd never gone to a world in a world's in a world.
It was very unlikely.
But that was a world where I could go really, right here on the ground, the richer and the exotic of what I'd ever could imagine these books.
So, I decided that I'd be a submotion at the age of 15.
And the only problem was that I lived in a small country in Canada, at 600 miles from the near ocean.
But I didn't leave me.
I brought up my father until he found a school until he found a school in Buffalo, New York, just spent the border where we lived.
And I've been able to take the certificate in a YMCA's filled with the winter in Buffalo, New York.
And I couldn't see the ocean, the real ocean, for other two years, until I moved to California.
From then, in the last 40 years, I've spent about 3,000 hours underwater, and 500 of those hours in submersible.
And I learned that the depth of the ocean, even deep oceans, are also rich of life, they're rich of life that actually goes beyond our imagination.
The imagination of nature's confined to our human imagination.
Again today, I'm intiming from what I see when I make the immersions.
And my story of love with the ocean continues, the stronger than it's ever been.
But when I chose a career, adult, I've chosen to do movie.
It seemed to be the best way to concile this smania to tell stories with the smania to create images.
And as a kid, I was constantly comics and so forth.
So movie was the only way to put together images and stories.
It was going back.
And of course, the stories I've chosen to tell were stories of science fiction: "Termintator," and "The Abyss."
And with "The Abyss," I join my love for the depth and immersions of a film.
So, I've got the two passions.
From "The Abyss came out of something interesting that was to solve a specific problem in that film, which is to create that sort of liquid water creature...... we adopt the generated liquid water creature -- we've adopted the computer.
And so it was born the first character at the surface and soup to the computer that had ever seen in a film.
And even though the film did not make a lot of money, I'd say that, I've been tremendous of something extraordinary, all the audience was hypnotized by this magic device.
You know, it's the Arthur Clarke for which every technology has sufficible is indistinguished by the magic.
They were seeing something magic.
And that's excited me.
And I thought, "Fantastic, this is a thing that has to be adopted in the movie art art art."
So, with "Earth" my next film, my next film, we're going to go very well.
Laving with the Industrial Light and Magic, we've created the guy's metal of liquid in that film. The success was going to work.
And it worked. And we've created a magic.
And we got the same results with a public.
But we made a little bit more with that film.
So, by tracking a line between these two points of experience, I came to the conclusion that this would have been a whole new world, it was all new world of creativity for artists.
So, I put a company in Stan Winston, my friend Stan Winston, my friend Stan Winston, who was the main trick and designer for creatures at that time, and we called Digal Domain.
And the principle of society was leaving the past, the analogical processes and so forth, and go directly to the digital production.
And so we did and gave us a competitive advantage for a while.
But we've been back to half the '90s in the part of creatures and characters, which is what we had to founded the society.
So, I've writing this ten called "" "" "with" His "with humans and realistic characters, and all the mainly generated the computer and the whole world.
And that's all been remaded to the mittent.
The companies have told me that we wouldn't be able to do it for a little bit.
So, I've accantepted this, and I did this film of a big ship.
I throw it out there as a "Romeo and Juliet on a ship."
It'd been a story of epic.
See, of course, what I wanted to do was immergerms to see the "Titanic."
That's why I did that film.
And it's the truth. I did not know.
But I've said, "We're going to go to the relity.
We're going to use it for the beginning of the film.
It's going to be very important. It's going to be a great marketing. "
And I've convinced them to funding.
It looks like crazy. But this takes us back to the imagination that creates reality.
Because we've actually created a reality and six months later, I found on a two miles in the Russian and a half of depth in Northern Atlantic, to watch the real Titanic, not in a film, not in a film, not in a film, not in a film, not in a film, not in a film, not in the movie, but to really.
I've been staged.
And it took a lot of preparation, we've had to build movie and lights and lots of other things.
But I've stayed out of the deep, it was like a space.
Where all of it was highly technical and require huge planning.
You'll put you in this capsule, you go down into this dark environment where there are no hope to be saved, you can't go back to.
And I thought, "Fantastic. It's like living in a science science fiction.
It's really great. "
And so, I've been affected by the depth of the ocean exploration.
Sure, curiosity, the scientific component.
It was all. It was all.
It was curiosity. It was imagination.
And it was an experience that Hollywood could not offer me.
Of course, I could imagine a creature effect and create a visual effect. But I couldn't imagine what I saw out of the hbling.
In our next next, I've seen creatures with hydrothermal and, sometimes, things I'd never seen before, things that no one had ever seen before, which was actually not even given by science to the time at the time that we saw them.
So I was all taken from this, and I had to do more.
So I took a curious decision.
After the success of "Titanic." I said, "OK, I'm going to go from Hollywood, and I do the explorer."
So, we started to planning these expeditions.
We found ourselves to go to the Bismark and explore it with robots.
We've come back to the Titanic.
We took little robots that we've created with the optics.
And the idea was to go inside and make a nickles inside of the ship, which had never been done.
No one had ever looked at the recruit. They didn't have the tools to do it, so we've created technology to do it.
So here I am on the Titanic, sitting in a submersible, looking at the asses that seemed like this, where I knew they looked just like this, where I knew that they were playing violinists.
And I'm driving a small vehicle through the corridors.
When I tell it, I'm driving it, but my mind is in the vehicle.
It seemed to be physically in the relity of the Titanic.
And it's the most surreal experience that I've ever lived, because before I knew what would be behind the corner, I knew what would have been behind, first that the lights of the vehicle it, because I'd run the film.
And the set was based on a replica of the ship of the ship model.
So it was an absolutely extraordinary experience.
And it really really made me to realize that in the experience of the telepresence that you can experience through these avatar robots, the mind is injected in this vehicle, in this other form of existence.
It was really very profound.
And it might be a small assage of what would happen between some decade when we start to have cycle of the edge of explores or the other reasons in some kind of the future that I can imagine, from the science fiction that I'm.
So, we did these expeditions, and I really started to appreciate what was there under, as the depth of the ocean where these were in the ocean, where there were these stayaries.
Basically, they're aliens right here on Earth.
They live in a chemosynthesis.
They don't survive in a system based on the sun as we do.
So, you're seeing animals that live close to 500 degrees to 500 degrees centigrade.
It seems even impossible that exists.
At the same time, I was really interested in the space, again, again, it's the influence of science fiction, as a kid.
And I ended up in the space environment, really involved with the NASA, seduced in the consultant of NASA, to the consultants of the NASA, to go to the international biomed-cosmonauty, and all of these things, to fly to fly the international station with our 3D cameras.
It was fascinating.
But what I've finished to do is to bring the space scientists with us in it.
And they could bring them down because they could have access -- astrobiologists, scientists, people who are interested in these extreme environments, bring them down and allow them to see, taking samples, and so on.
So we were documentary documentes, but we actually did science, space.
I had closed the ring between being fan of science fiction, as a kid, to do those things really.
And you know, during this path of discovery, I've learned a lot.
I learned a lot of science. But I've learned a lot about leadership.
They all think that a regist should be a leader, the capital of the ship, or something like that.
I didn't know about leadership before they're doing all these expeditions.
Why at some point I had to say, "What am I doing here?
Why am I doing this? What do I get? "
You don't make all of these show.
Let's go to pari. There's no famous.
People think it's gone between "Titanic" and "Avatar" and "Have" and "I'm going to be a little bit.
I've done all these filmmakers for a limited audience so limited.
No famous, no glory, no money. What am I doing?
I'm doing it for the task in itself, and the ocean is the largest challenge is the largest challenge that exists, for the bridge of discovery, and for that strange connecting when a small group of people form a very compact team.
Because we did all 10-12 people, working together for years.
Sometimes in the sea for 2-year-old.
And in that lead, you realize what's important is that it's the important is that they have for you, when you've finished a task that you can't explain anybody else.
When you go back to the ground and explains, "We had to do this, and the fibers, and the attention, and that, all the technology, and that, all the technology, and the attention of the human perfoot, when you're working in the sea -- you can't explain. It's what maybe they just have the policy or the soldiers or lived,
Being a connection, create a connection of respect.
When I came back to make my next movie, which is "I've tried to apply the same principle of leadership, I've tried to apply the team and make their own.
It's really changed the dynamics.
And so there I'm still there with a little group, in the inexploring "Avatar" with new new technologies that didn't exist before.
That's exciting.
It's very challenging.
And we got a family, in the four and a half years.
And it completely changed the way of my film.
People's realized that I took the organisms from the ocean and I put them on the planet Pandora.
For me, it was the essence of the way to do business, the process itself, which had changed.
What can we then then then?
What are the lessons we've learned?
I think the first is curiosity.
It's the most powerful thing that is.
The imagination is a force that can actually manifest.
And the respect of the group is more important than all the around the world.
Giovans come from me and say, "Dama few advice to do this."
And I say, "Don't get limit.
Other people will do it for you, don't make it alone, you don't stop it against you.
And you're going to run. "
The NASA is always saying, "the mistake is not contemplated."
But the mistake has to be an option in the art and exploration, because it's like a room in the empty.
And there's an important attempt was done without risks.
You need to be willing to those risks.
This is the thought that I want to leave you, which is that in whatever you do, the mistake is an option, but I'm not. Thank you.
If I wanted to give you a big idea of it would be that the set of the data that we use is larger than the sum of its parts, and that, instead of thinking about the much information, I'd like to think about how to use information to make new relationships so that we can see new trend, otherwise invisible.
So here you can see the typical mortality statistic mortality.
This tool that I use is a little experiment.
It's called Pivot, and with Pivot, I can choose to filter one cause of death, let's say accidents.
And they're going to see new relationships.
The reason is that here in the central part, the people are more fragile.
We can take a step back and reorganize data because of death, let's see that circulators and cancer are the biggest Indian, but not for everybody.
If we're going forward and filter for the age, let's see that the accidents are the cause of death I worry more.
It's closer, it's a lot of men.
So you're going to understand that visualize information and data in these way is a little bit like swimming in a sea of information of graphy.
And if we can do this with data, because we can't even do it with content?
For example, we have the cover of every Sports Illustrated.
That's it. Everything.
You can get into your rooms, and you can try.
With Pivot you can see a decade.
Or a specific year.
You can issue a particular number.
For example, let's take the athletes like this number, their sports.
I'm a fan of Lance Armstrong, so click here and I see all the numbers where the numbers where Lance Armstrong.
Now, if I want to give us a look at this, I could think, why don't give a look at all the cycle? "
I'm a step back and alargo through the visual.
And now I see Greg Lemond.
And you'll have understood that when you navigate in this information, and it's not just a research, it's not just a research, it's not just a research, it's not just the browser.
But you do something slightly different.
It's a half that we're going to change how we can use information.
Let's still this idea that can look a little bit crazy.
We took every single page of Wikipedia and we reduced it to a brief short, which is in a little synossis, and an icona that's the tematics area.
I'll just show you the first 500 between the most visits of Wikipedia.
Even in this screen, we can do a lot.
You know, they're going to understand what areas are the most visited about Wikipedia.
At this point I'm sitting there.
We're seeing that option we see that Wikipedia more often associated with this voice are the "Personages of Time Magazine."
That's meaningful because it's emerge.
And you're going to see it only a step back to see the together.
If I'm going to take one of these sums, I can then zooming on's "Time Magazine."
and see them.
In this point, I see that most of the governmentally from some of the world of science. A minor number of affairs.
Here's my boss.
One is from music.
And, pretty interesting, Bono has also won a TED.
So we're going to see all the winners of TED.
For the first time we're going to be able, as if it's a network, not from the page, but at a level of abstraction.
I want to show you another thing that might surprise you.
This is the New York Times.
Lvot, this application -- we don't call browser, because it's not a browser, but we need to see web -- we add this technology for zoom in the web, like this.
I can take a step back and go back to a specific section. That's important because just seeing the web pages so that's just seeing the web for me in the Internet to the same way.
I can zooming on what I did in specific moments.
In fact, you can see the state of the demo that I just presented.
I can have some sense to resee other things I've seen in the day.
If I want to take a step back and see all I can do at the pet of my historian or the historian of my research or the historian.
Here I was looking at the Bing engine, I was looking for Live Labs here for Live Labs Pivot.
And from here I can zoom in on my web, and just just throw away from here.
It's a lot of times times, and in every case, and in every case, the outcome is larger than the sum of the parts, the data.
In the world, the data is seen as a kind of malbuilding.
It's about information.
It's about the data.
What if we put down down on the other, if we put the web on the other side, we would take it from a lot of things to another, and then we could actually see those structures that would otherwise the structures that would otherwise the structures that would otherwiring would be born?
And then instead of being trapped into the data, we could really extract information.
Instead of all of the information, we can pull out of knowledge.
And from the knowledge, maybe you're also in the wisdom.
And with that thank you.
This is all the time they're talking about happiness.
And I asked to count the number of books the word "happiness" happiness and published in the last five years, they stopped count after they're going to 40, and there were a lot more.
There's a huge wave of interest on happiness, some researchers.
There's a lot of coaching happiness.
Everybody would want to make more happy people.
But despite all this flow of work, there's a series of cognitive trap, which somehow impossible we can actually elaborate ideas about happiness.
My talk is going to be more importantly these "cognitive traps."
And it's about profit from people who think about their happiness, and it's about the study that we're confused as everybody else.
The first of these traps is the retlater to admit the complexity.
And it turns out that the word happiness is no longer a word useful as much as much as much as much as it looks like the one is to too much of the fields.
And I think that's going to take a particular meaning, but in massive line, we're going to have to tell us about this acceptions and we're going to have to take a more complicated view of what is the well-being. "
The second trap is the confusion between experience and memory: it's basically to choose between being happy in life and be happy about their lives.
And these are two extremely different concept, both part of the concept of happiness.
And the third one is the illusion of focus that is unfortunate the unfortunate that we can't think of the circumstance.
I mean, it's a real cognitive trap.
and there's no way to do the right thing.
I'd like to start with an example of a person who, after a session and answers, after my lesson, telling a story.
[Disse] Disse while listening to an absolutely magnificent music.
And then he added in a very emotional way, which he had bought the whole experience.
But that was not true.
And what it was broken was the memory of the experience.
He had lived the experience.
And he was listened for 20 minutes of music.
but it wasn't counted for nothing because he's reminded with a certain memory; The reminder was ruined, and the memory of what was left.
So what this is says to us in the bottom, is that we could think of ourselves and other people in terms of two "is that we could think of ourselves and other people in terms of two."
There's a site that lives in the present, which lives in the present and knows the present, and it's capable of relive the past, but that actually only has the present.
It's the self self that's living in the experiences, "You know when the doctor asking," Ti's bad now, when the doctor ask, "Ti's bad now, when you get there?"
And then there's the self self that's called "that's itself, it's about" that's signs, and it's that's the doctor gets in asking, "How do you're heard in the last time?"
or something like that.
Those are two differently, the self that's living an experience and what if the memories, and they're going to reconfusion between the notion of happiness.
The self, it's a singer.
And this process begins with a fundamental response of our memories -- started immediately.
We don't tell stories when we decide to tell them.
Our memory tells us stories, which is, what's remains of our experiences is a story.
Let me start with an example.
It's an old study.
That reports the experiences of two patients in a painful process.
I wouldn't get into the details. It's not even painful today, but it was painful when this study was conducted in the '90s.
You asked the patients to bring their pain every 60 seconds.
And here's the results for two patients.
Those are the results.
If you ask, "Who two suffered more?"
It's a very simple question.
Yeah, the Patient B has suffered.
his colony coloned more and for every minute of pain of pain, A patient's suffered from the patient's patient's suffered from the patient's patient.
But now there's another question, "How about these patients think they suffered?"
And here's the surprise: That's Patient had a memory of the colonscope of the Patient B.
The colonful stories were a lot of different part of the procedure of the procedure is the way -- no one of those stories is particularly, but one of the two is a different --
And the worst is that where the pain was mainly in the final moment.
It's a negative story.
How do I know it?
Because we asked these people after the colonscope, and even at the time distance of time, "How negative was the experience, all considered?"
and it's a much worse for B, in the memory.
So it's a direct conflict between the site that live experiences and the site that reminds them.
On the site's point of view that lives, it's clear that B has suffered most.
So, what you could do for the patient A, and we've done clinical experiments, and it was actually done, and it works, you could extend the tube without going to go.
That's going to cause a pain in in the patient, but only a little bit, and less than before.
And by doing this for a couple minutes, the sis that live the experience of the Patient's experience. It's going to be worth better, because now the Patient A's now the Patient has a better memory of his experience.
How do you call a story?
And that's true of the stories that are from the reminds that for the stories that we invent. And that defines a story, are the significant changes and the final moments.
The final is very, very important and, in this case, the final dominated.
So, the smooth that lives lives in a long way.
It's been experiences that they're going to ask you, "What happens to these moments?
And the answer is simple.
They're always trying to tell that most of the times of our life -- as I've calculated -- as I've calculated -- I've been doing about 600 million of them. In a month, if they're count.
Most of them are completely ignored by the way.
And yet, in some way you have the feeling that they should count, that what happens in these moments of experience is our life.
It's the limited resources that we're spending as we are in this world.
And as a spends it, it would seem to be relevant, but it's not the story that the site that reminds for us.
So we've got a site that reminds and a site that lives of experiences that are quite different.
The largest difference between the two is like treating time.
From the site's point of experiences, if you're in vacances, and the second weeks is funny as the first, then the vacation of two weeks is a week.
But that's absolutely not the way that works.
It's why it reminds, a two-weeks is better than a week of vacation, because there's no new memories, because there's no new memories.
You didn't change the story.
And this way, the time is the variable of critical variable that's reminds that's reminds that lives.
The time has a limited impact on this story.
Well, the sone that reminds the experiences makes more than remember and tell stories.
It's actually the self self that make decisions because, if we consider a patient who's had, for example, two different medical colonscopes with two different doctors and deciding who's going to be chosen less "" negative, "and that's going to be chosen.
The sets that live experiences doesn't have voice in those choices.
In fact, we don't choose between experiences, but between the memories of those experiences.
And even when we think about our future, we don't think about our future as experiences.
So let's think of our future as a memories.
You can basically consider this situation, like a sanny of the site that reminds, and you can think of the sis that memories, and you can think of the site that it's living in experiences, it doesn't need.
I have the feeling that when we're going on in vacance, often the case that's vacance to the service of our site.
And this is a little bit hard to justify.
That's how much we consume our memories?
That's one of the explanations that's been given for the predominance of the site.
When I think of that, I'm in my mind is in the Antarctica of a few years ago, which is one of the best vacances of my life, and where I think relatively, compared to other vacations.
And I'm probably going to think of that journey of three weeks, to say, 25 minutes in the last four years.
If I'd ever opened up the 600 photographs of the journey, I'd spent another another now. It's three weeks of journey that translates into male. It looks like that there's a argument.
Well, I could be a little bit extreme, in my waste for the consumption of reminds, but even if you do more than this, a question genuine is pone.
Why are we weight to the memory of the weight that we make experiences?
I want you to think of an experiment with thinking.
Imagine that in the next vacances that at the end of the vacances, all of the photographs will be destroyed, and you take a medicine for the love to you.
Would you get the same vacance? What if you could choose a different vacance, it creates a conflict between the two, and you have to think of how to solve that conflict and actually isn't so obvious because, if you think in terms of time in terms of time, then you're going to have an answer.
And if you think in terms of memories, you might get another answer.
Because we choose the vacations we do, it's a problem that's a problem that puts us in front of the two.
The two is slate two notion of happy.
There's actually two concepts of happy concepts that we can use, one for each site.
So you can ask: How much is happy the sone that makes the experience?
And then you can ask: How happy are the moments in the life of the site that lives lives?
And it's about -- happiness for times, it's a complicated process.
What are the emotions we can measure?
And by the way, now we're able to do a good idea of happiness of the site that lives lives in time.
If you ask the site of the site that remember, it's a completely different thing.
It's not how long it's alive.
It's about how much it's the person when you think about his life.
It's a very different idea.
Anyone's not able to distinguish these two notions, it "to make confusion" in studies about happiness, and I bought to a group of students of well-being, who have gone to the studies about happiness for a long time in this way.
The difference between the site of the sis that live the experiences and satisfaction of the satisfaction that memory has been recognized over the last years, and they're now in the effort to measure the two separately, the Gallup of the world where more than half a million people have been underposte to one on what they think about their lives and their experiences.
And there were other studies in this direction.
So in the last few years, we started to learn about the happiness of two.
And the largest lesson we learned, is that are very different.
You could know how much one person is to be satisfied with their life, and yet this doesn't tell you about how much happily they're going to tell you about how to live their life and vice.
To give you an idea of correlation, the correlation is about 0.5..
which means that if I met someone, and they said, "oh, his father and" oh, "Oh," how much would you know?
Well, you'd know something about his height, but with a lot of uncertainty.
You'd always have a little bit of uncertainty.
If I tell you that someone thinks his life is at the level eight in a scale from one to a ten, you're going to be very uncertain to how happy to be with their own shares.
So correlation is low.
We've got a certain knowledge of what controls is happy.
We know that money is very important, the goals are very important.
We know that being happy means to be satifacts with the people who like us, spend time with the people that they like us.
There's a more pleasure, but these are the main ones.
So if you want to maximize the happiness of two, you'll end up doing very different things.
The conclusion of what I've been told to think about happiness as well as a subitute of well-being.
This is completely different.
In the more, very quickly, another reason that we can't think in a linear way of happiness is that we don't pay attention to the same things when we think about life, and when we live.
And so, if you do the simple question of how happy people are in California, you can't get the answer correct.
When you ask this question, you think you should be happily happy in California, that in Ohio.
What's happening when you think about life in California, you're thinking about the contest between California and other places, and for example is on the climate.
Well, it turns out that climate isn't as important for the site that lives lives in the experiences and it's not very important for the seven is that reflects as happy.
But because of the seven is that reflects is in charge, you might end -- some people might end, at the end, you could end, move in California.
And it's interesting verify what's going to happen to people transfer in California in the hope of being happily.
Well, the smooth that live experiences won't become happy.
We know it.
But something's going to happen. They're thinking about being happily, because when they think, they'll remember how terrible it was time in Ohio.
And they're going to think I've made the right.
It's very difficult to think of well-being and I think I gave you the idea of how difficult it is.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have a question for you.
Thank you very much.
When we were at the telephone a couple of weeks ago, I mentioned me that a interesting result of the Gallup.
It's something we think we've still a few minute?
Daniel Kaheman: Yeah.
I think the thing that we've found that we found in the Gallup is a number, which we didn't expect to find.
We've found that, with reference to the site that lives.
When we've observed as feelings, we've found that, we've found that, under an income of 60,000 dollars a year, for the Americans, on a very large sample of about 600,000 U.S. Americans, it's a sample of 600,000 dollars a year --
CA: 60,000 DK: 60,000 dollars a year, people are infelected, and they become progressive, and they become progressively more than the poor, to go.
I mean, I've seen the lines.
clearly, what's happening is that the money doesn't buy happiness of the experience, but the lack of denate money certainly, and we can measure that very, very, very clearly.
In terms of the other is, the site that reminds, is all another story.
The more money you make, the more content six.
It's not about emotions.
CA: But Danny, everybody's effort of Americans are about life, freedom, the search of happiness.
If people took this seriously discovery, basically, which is what we believed, for instance, politics on the pocket and so on.
There's a chance that politicians, and the nation in general, can take a discovery like that seriously and bring a public policy based on it?
DK: You know I think you recognize the role of happiness in public politics.
The present of consideration will be slows in the United States, there's no doubt, but in the U.K., it's become reality, and in others.
People are starting to recognize that they should think about happiness when they think about public politics.
It's going to be a little bit, and people are going to talk about if they want to study the experience of happiness or if they want to study the value of life that we need to start this debate to the most soon.
As you can grow the happy directions, it takes different directions to the second of how you think, and depending on the site that you're thinking, and depending on the site that makes experiences.
All of this is going to influence the politics, I think, in the years that will be.
In the United States, they're doing effort to measure the experience of population.
And this, I think, it's going to go into the next decade, maybe maybe two, of the national statistics.
CA: Well, it seems to me that this is going to be, or less should be, the argument of the most interesting politics to follow in the next few years.
Thank you very much for making invented the behavioral economics.
Thank you Danny Kaheman.
I'm going to talk about energy and climate.
It can look strange, because I've seen that in my work to the foundation of vaccines and seeds, things to invent and give the world to help the two billion poorest people to live lives better.
But climate and energy, actually, in fact, they're extremely important for these people, they're more important to them to the world.
It's a worst climate means, for many years, loss.
It's going to be too much rain, or too little.
The things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support.
which brings to hunger. The conflict.
Climbs, they're going to be for them terrible.
Even the cost of energy is, for them, important.
In fact, if you could put the price of one thing, to reduce poverty, you would choose about a lot of energy.
The price of the energy price goes down over time.
And it's a civilization of energy progress in the energy fields.
The coal revolution has food that industrial.
And even in the 20th century, we've been watching a quick decline in the price of electricity, which explains why we have refrigered, and doing so many things.
In the rich world, so we're as much about electricity in a excellent situation.
But as the price scenes, for example of the half, we have to respect a new wind, the constitution of CO2 emissions.
CO2 is heating the planet, and its equation is very simple.
The CO2 emitted as a temperature of temperature, which induces very negative.
It's about climate and, maybe even worse, even worse, indeed, in the sense that the natural ecosystems can't look at these quickly changes and so they collapse.
The evaluation of how much classroom temperature because of a given increase in CO2, and as each of the two worst things, the other, and uncertainly, but not.
And there's certainly uncertainty about how negative will be such bad effectively, but they're going to be bad.
Now, I've often asked the best scientists: Do we have to make emissions of zero?
We can't only reduce them half or a fourth?
And the answer is that, until we don't go down to zero, the temperature will continue to go.
It's a big challenge, so.
It's not like to say, "Let's move a 3.5 feet under a bridge."
It's not the "it's a bit."
It's got to go down to zero.
Now, we make a lot of CO2 every year, over 26 billion tons.
About 20 tons for every American.
For the inhabitants of poor countries, it's less of a tons in the poor.
The world's media is about five tons per capita.
And somehow, we need to do progress that zero.
The emissions are constantly increased.
Only some economic changes have changed this tendency, so so we have to move from increasingly diminually quickly to zero.
This equation has four factors.
It's a series of multiply.
We've got how much left, the CO2, which has been building, and the factors on the right are the population, the services, the services that in every person use, the average energy is used to each person, the services and the CO2 eman of energy.
Let's look at each factor and see how we can get it.
Probably, one of these numbers have to go down to almost zero.
It's high school.
Let's see a little bit.
The first factor is the population.
The world today is 6.8 billion people.
We go to the nine billion.
If we make a good job with new vaccines, health, healthcare, we can be reproductive, we can declaring the maybe 10, 15 percent, but here we're going to record the increase of about 30 percent.
The second factor are the services we use.
Which understanding all, the food we eat, the dress, TV, the TV, the heat.
It's willing, and liberate to rise of poverty, it's going to have some services for almost all the world.
And it's a positive thing that's.
In the rich world, in the richest billion, we could probably save and use less, but in media, every year, this number will go.
And so, complex services, the amount of services that you're going to be more than twice.
This is a very simple example of service.
You've got the illumination in your house, to do the tasks, but these kids don't, so they except and read their tasks.
The efficiency -- and, the energy for unit's energy for unit -- here finally, there's good news.
This factor is not increasing.
Thank you very much, new ways of illuminate, new ways of illuminate, highly constructions made differently, for many services, in many of the services of the energy consumption.
In some services, you can reduce 90 percent.
There's some other services, like fertilizers, or the airplane, where the margin of improving are very, very, very inferior.
So, it's the best of the cases, the energy consumed can reduce them from three to maybe six times.
But these first three factors will reduce emissions from 26 to the best cases, maybe 13 billion tons.
It's not enough.
Let's look at the fourth factor, the key amount of CO2 emit for units of energy.
The question is, can we reduce the zero?
If you burn coal, no.
If you burn natural gas, no.
Almost all the ways of producing today the electricity, except the cuts and nuclear, CO2.
What we're going to have to do on a global scale.
And we need the miracles.
It's called "miracle," I don't mean something impossible.
The microprocessor is a miracle. The personal computer is a miracle.
The Internet, and its services, they're a miracle.
People today here today have been in the creation of many miracles.
We don't normally have a scade, a date within which we have a data by releasing.
Usually, it's at the window and something happens, something else's not.
In this case, we've got to lead to all speeds, and make a very rise.
I asked myself, how to illustrate this concept?
Is there a few natural example, some demonstration that capture capture the imagination of people?
I've got a year ago, when you take the mosquitos, and people found it.
They're going to be a partner, in the world, there are people living with mosquitos.
This is my idea for energy.
And I decided that I wanted to the lights would have been this year my contribution.
Here's the lights here.
They tell me that they don't get out of the board.
... now, we can invest tricks like this, but they're not going to be help.
We need solutions, a lot or a lot of them are, which will work on big scale and very reliable, and though they're exploring in a lot of directions, I think that only five few important effects.
I've got the mareas, the geoterm, nuclear fusion, nuclear fusion.
They could also give some contribution, and if they can do more than I think, as much better, but here I'll be interested in that we're going to be able to work on each of these five, and not give up any of those five, and not give up to any of those five, and not give up a lot of difficult challenges.
Let's look at the first fuels of fossil fuels, coal or natural gas.
Here's our task looks simple, but it's not, and it's captured the CO2, after the combuston, at the bottom, present it, put it in some part, and hope that's left.
Today, there's experimental technologies that captured 60 -- 80 percent of CO2, but they're going to be very complicated, and it's going to be very difficult, and it's going to be able to agree about where this CO2.
The spinous issue is still the long time.
Who will trust you?
Who guaranteed something that's literally billions of times more volume than all sorts of imaginable, like nuclear or else?
It's a huge volume.
So it's a difficult problem.
Another is the nuclear would be the nuclear.
But the nuclear presents three big problems.
The cost, especially in the very regulate countries, it's high.
The question of security, the security feeling that nothing can go wrong, sick the employment of human workers, and that the lovely not security to use beautiful.
And how then run the scories?
The amount of laughing, concerns are many.
People need to be embedded.
So, you're very difficult problems, so that we could solve, and what we should work.
The last three of the five sources, I bought them.
They're the people often defining renewables.
And that's the big advantage of not to require a combustible, present some of the disadvantages.
The first is that the energy density produced with these technologies is clearly inferior to that one of an electric central central.
It's about collecting energy, and so many squares, and so many squares, of thousands of times more estese than a normal electric central.
Also, these sources are intermittent.
The sun doesn't have all day, nor every day, and every day, and even the wind suffering.
So, if you're depends on these sources, you need to find a way of electrical energy even when the source doesn't produce.
It's facing us on the front of the cost.
And the distribution.
For example, let's say that this source source is in the sumption.
So you don't just need the technology, but you're also going to have to do with the risks of apply.
And finally, the accumulation problem.
To estimate the size of the problem, I've analyzed all kinds of bacterial, computers, telephones, from any, I've compared to the amount of electrical energy used in the world, and I found that all the bacterial energy.
So we really need a big step forward, an improvement of 100 times as we approach to use.
And that's not impossible, but it's not very simple.
This problem is already manifest when the sources "intermittent," produce more than, 20 to 30 percent of the energy consumed.
And then you go down to those sources for 100 percent, you need a battery. "
But how are we going on on on this street? What is the right approach?
It's a Manhattan? What could this solve the problem?
A lot of companies, hundreds, they have to get to work.
We need at least percent people in each of these five sectors.
Most of them, look at them, you'd say, you're going to be good.
And I think that here, in the TED group, a lot of people are already working in these fields.
Bill Gross has different companies, including a called eSolar that vant big technologies in the thermical solar technology.
Vinod Khosla is investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting pots, and I'm giving my support to this.
Nathan Myhrvold and I are funding a company that, you're going to go and follow the way of the nuclear.
There's some innovations in the range, the nuclear nuclear, the nuclear nuclear nuclear.
But from a long bit of time, the sector is stopped, which there are some good ideas on it's not so surprising.
The idea of Terrapower is that, instead of burning only part of the uranium, the U235, the one percent of the uranio, we've decided to burn the U238, 99 percent. It's a crazy idea, in a way.
It's about it for a long time, but it's never been taught if it would work or no, it's because of it's going to work. You can do a simulation and see that yes, with the right materials, it seems to work.
And because it's 99 percent of the uranium, the structure of the costs midst midst.
You burn the scories, and they're using the scories, and they're using reactors of today, which became, from the problem that they were, a exploiting resources.
They consume the uranium while the uranio. It's a kind of candela.
It's like a straightforce of wood. It's called the one-on-progressive.
On the point of fuel, the problem is solved.
Here's a picture of a place in Kentucky.
That's the 99 percent uranium, which has been taken over the time as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well, and so it's called impoverished.
These are going to be energy to the United States for centuries.
And by filter sea water, with an economic process, there would be enough fuel for the rest of the life of this planet.
So a lot of challenges tend to us, but this is an example of hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to progress.
How should we measure our progress?
What should be the pages?
Let's refer the goal, and then we're going to be able to intermeds.
You've heard a lot of people talking about an 80 percent reduction for 2050, it's really important to do.
20 percent will be produced by poor countries, and from a little bit of agriculture.
At that point, we're going to be solved the deforestation and production.
So to get 80 percent, so the developed countries like China, including countries like China, they're going to have to replace their electrical production.
The other question is, we're doing this technology to zero emissions?
We basically put it in the developed countries?
Do we're going to spread high?
It's a very important thing.
It's a key part of the pages.
And when we're going to look at the page of 2020?
That should have the same two aspects.
We'd have to implements to start to get reductions.
We're going to be the lower amount of CO2, and so the temperature.
But the vote in this material, doing things that don't make great reductions, it's just a weight paral, or even slightly inferior, at the other, which is the speed of the innovation of new invention.
We need to push these progress to all speed, and we can measure the speed from the number of companies, and we can measure the speed from the number of companies,
Very great books have been written about.
The book of Al Gore, "Pchoice," and David McKay, "" Hot Air. "
These books learn the problem and create a context in which they create a context in which they need the debate because these things need to be needed to the spread.
A lot of things have to have to be contemporary.
So I have a wish, I have a wish.
It's a very concrete that we're going to invent technology.
If I had to choose one wish for the next 50 years, to be able to choose the president of the country, the achievement of a vaccine, which I'm doing a vaccine, or I would choose this last.
It would be the greater impact.
If this wish wouldn't be done, the fruit between who thinks at the short and the long-term, between the United States and China, between poor and rich, will be terrible, and more importantly, the life of those two billion people will be much worse.
So what do we need to do?
So what's I'm inviting you to take the initiative and get?
It's necessary a larger support for research.
When nations come together in places like Copenhagen, they wouldn't have to talk about CO2.
They should argue the program of innovations, and you'd be able to study in these innovative approaches.
We need incentives, taxes on CO2, the "cap and transforms, tools that clear the cost of pollution.
We need to spread the message.
We need to make this more rational dialogue, and it needs to include the government choices.
It's a prevent desire, but I think.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Just to know more about Earth, you know, here...
first of all, can you give us an idea of the size of the investments?
Bill Gates: Realizing the software, get the supercomputer, to hire all great scientists, what we've done, requires just tens of millions, and even when we're tested, and even when we're tested to the materials in a safely, we're going to have to talk only about hundreds of millions.
The difficult thing is to build the pilot, to build the reactor, finding several billion, the authority, the place where it's going to be built the first examples.
Once built the first, if it works as announced, it's going to be the egger of Colombo, because the cost of generated energy, they're completely different from nuclear today.
CA: So if I understand well, this implics of the construction, well underground, of a nuclear remarkable nuclear fuels, of this kind of uranium.
Then the process begins from the top and progress?
BG: Right. The reactors, today, they're restricted, continuously, many people, many controls that can't work, open, continue, things that enter and except,
It's not good.
If instead of the fuel is very cheap and you can make it for 60 years, put it inside and forget all those complexity.
It's sessing there, burn for the years, and then you end up.
CA: It's a nuclear wearing itself!
BG: Yeah. Well, the waste can leave there, and then you can take them in another reactor and burn them.
And we're going to begin with existing, we're now conserved to cooling or containers or in the front of the reactors.
They'll be our first fuel.
So what it was a problem of conventional reactors will be the fuel of our, and the volume of reactors, and the reflew will reduce, not just this process.
CA: But when you're talking around the world of the potential of this technology, where most interest in its achieving?
BG: Well, there's no place in particular, and there's all these interesting rules of transparency on everything that is defined nuclear, so let's return a lot of interest.
Our staff was in Russia, India, China.
I just met the Sgretary for Energy.
We've talked about how this idea is the current program.
I'm optimistic. Francese and Japanese did work in this field.
It's a variation on something that's already been done.
It's an essentially improvement, but it's a fast reactor, that many countries have already built a good reactor, and so anyone who's already built a good reactor.
CA: What are the time and the probability that are and the probability that something like that?
BG: Well, for one of these large-scale projects that produces energy, which produces not very much, we're talking about 20 years to design and 20 years to build it.
It's a scade that the environmental models are demonstrates.
And that's okay, that's not very little, that's a question.
And now they're unfortunately, dozens of companies in the sector, that's working, who's funding for their plants are going to be eroged, they can compare.
And it's better if a lot of solutions will happen, because at that point is going to be able to remind to a set of solutions.
It's necessary that at least a success.
CA: Parlying of important innovations, revolutionally revolutionier, this is the largest you know?
BG: A revolution is the most important thing.
It would be also without the environmental winners, but the environmental winners make it really much more important.
We have more innovators.
We don't know their job like this, but a nuclear is the nuclear "modular, a different approach.
There's a liquid reactor. It seems to be hard to do, but maybe they say the same thing of us.
So there's different, but the good is that a lot of urany molecule in a million times more energy than a million times more energy of a molecule, say, carbon, so if you can run the negative aspects, the potential aspects, the potential of effectively on the environment, and other, it makes a classroom.
CA: And if it doesn't work?
Shouldn't we have to be able to go to emergency room temperature?
BG: If you're in that situation, it's a little bit like when you eat too, and you're going to have a heart attack.
Where do you go to that point? You could have to find a surgeon or something like it.
There's a research line on the geoengineering called geoengineering, which are various techniques that slower down to make us earn 20 or 30 years in which they coordinate the action.
It's like cleaning a polar.
I hope you don't need it.
Some people say they wouldn't even work on the police, because you might be going to continue to eat because the surgeon will go.
I don't think it's a mark choice, view the importance of the problem, but now in the environment of the geoengineering asks to us if you're going to take to the solutions of them in the case that events, or innovations come later.
CA: Clima-skeptical: if you had a sentence or two from dir them, like persuade persuade that they've gone?
BG: Well, unfortunately, there's different kinds of skeptical and the ones who have a very few.
Some people say that there's a negative feedback to the clouds of warming.
They're very, very, very few things that you can just say that there's one probability on a million that's going to have the main problem looks like the AIDS looks like.
You put a mistake now and pay for the consequences just a lot later.
And so, when you're in a thousand emergency, the idea of making sacrifice you're just after --
It's not well notes.
In fact, the IPP.C.'s not necessarily the worst case; there's people in the rich world that look at the IPPC and says: "it's not so much.
The fact is that the uncertainty should pushing us on action.
But my dream is that, if I'm going to do it economic, and to respect the constraints on CO2, then the skeptics will tell me if I don't emit, but I'm going to be because it's cheap because it's cheap because it's more cheap than prefer technologies.
CA: Would it be the answer to the Bjorn Lomborg, that if you invest all the energy problem, that if you investments all the energy problem, your other targets, will sacrifice, are they going to be sacrifice, when there's better, when there's the best to do, it means to sprect resources?
BG: Well, the effect in research and development --
We say that the U.S.A should spend 10 billion as more than how much they do now.
It shouldn't have to distrate resources.
And the things that make a lot of money, and here are also reasonable to dishear, they're financial solutions.
For me, it's more importantly, the waste.
Unless you're not funding the curve of learning, getting closer to the point where they're going to be very cheap, I think that the effort will be very cheap.
If the alternative is: "we make the expensive energy, so that only only rich, so that only rich can afford, all the present to pay the energy five times so much without change.
The disaster would be for those two billion.
And also Lomborg has reviewed his positions.
His issue now is, "Why don't it's not discussing and Svilup?"
It's for his past again, you're going to collapse, but he's understood that's a line, and so he's going to be switched by the Research and Svilup.
And it's a question that I think is appropriate.
It's incredible as a little bit of research and development.
CA: Well Bill, I think I'm just going to speak to the most of the audience of the audience that I'll become reality. Thank you.
BG: Thank you.
I'd like to share with you a discovery that I did a few months ago when I was writing an article in Wired.
I've always got my dictionary of the mayer of hand every time I write something, but I'd done, but I've already done my life tried the word "disaster to see what I would find.
Let me read you the results.
"Disable", agricultural: damage, no matter, useless, useless, inhurt, retreated, eradicated, fuel, heaven, heaven, decreased, heaven, impoverished, impoverished, depit, Senile, decrease, Senile, decrease, decrepit, burn, however, cut out of the circumstances and.
Contrarians: In shape, powerful.
I was reading this list to a very high voice to a friend and at the beginning, it was so ridiculous, but, just just my voice went, and I had to stop to get me to pick me up to the shock and the impact that the above the shock of these words left.
You know, we're talking about, of course, an old Middle sympymous.
I'm thinking, it's going to be an old building, right.
But, in fact, the ediition was the first 80 years.
When I was starting my elementary schools and I was forming and learning what was out of my family and things in other children and the world around me.
and, I used to say it, thank God, I wasn't using the dictionary of syonymous at that time.
I mean, from this explanation looks like that I've been born in a world that sees someone like me as one that has no positive in any positive so for them, when, in fact today, they're celebrated for the opportunities and venture that my life has done.
So, I'm immediately going to see on the building of 2009 in the network, waiting me to find a review without value.
This is the version of description.
Unfortunately, it's not much better.
I've found the last two words underneath "particularly recommend," the whole "and" healthcare "and" healthy. "" "and" healthy. "
that's what we think about people when we see them with these words.
It's about the values behind these words, and how we build these values.
Our language influence our thinking and our vision of the world and how we see other people.
In fact, many civilization, including that Greek and Romana, believed that Greek and that Romana, they had to say that was more powerful, because to say things to the high voice was there.
So what reality we want to bring there, a person who's limited, or a person with more force?
So, we casually doing something simple as nominate a person, a baby, we could put tapes and throw shadows on their strength.
Wouldn't we want to open doors for them?
One person so, who opened me the doors, it was the doctor of that I was a little girl at the time, I was a little girl at the time, Delaware.
His name is Dr. Pizztor.
ItaloAmerican, the name that he was just too difficult to say to a major part of the Americans, so it was going to be a Ph.P.
And the Ph.D.D. were always paylon, and he had a perfect inclation to work with children.
I was practically anything of the period that I've spent in the hospital, with the exception of sessions.
I had to do what they looked infinite repetition of exercises with these elastic large fases, in different colors, you know, to help me build the muscles of legs.
And I hate these more than everything.
I would hate them, really hate them.
And, you know, I'd already know, like one of five years, with Dr. P to try to go down from these exercises, and I'd know.
And one day, a day, came to one of my Stanks and inexorable, these seats.
and he said, "wow, Aimee, you're a young girl so strong, I think you're going to break one of those fases.
"When you're going to give you 100 dollars."
Now, of course, it was just a little maneuver to make me exercises that I didn't want to do in front of being the second plan, but, what he was done, it was to shape a different shape to a horrible routine day.
and turn it into an interesting experience for me.
And I wonder today, the entity of his vision, and of his declaration is about me as a young girl, she redefined my vision itself in a strong, poderly and athletic person to the future.
This is an example of how adults with power positions of power can infy the force of a child.
But, in the example of the vocabulary of the vocabulary, our language's not the possibility of evolve towards reality that we would all want to do, the possibility of an individual to watch itself.
Our language was not the step of the changes of our societies, many of which have been created by technology technology.
certainly, from a medical point of view, my legs, laser operations to leave the view, knees of titanium and also receive for agrics, and also to move beyond the ability that they're helping people to cooperate with their ability, and they're going to deal with the social network, and they're allowed to identify their own, so they can go to to.
So maybe the technology is going to revealing us now to be a truth, which each one has something rare and poderly that each one has something rare and poderly to our society, and the human ability to adapt to us is our greater quality.
Human ability to adapt us, is something interesting, because people always wanted to talk to me about the tremendous and I've got to talk about it.
This sentence has never gone well, and I've been very well, and I'm always feeling to people to this, and I think I'm beginning to understand why.
It's underwear in this sentence, insurprise, it's the idea that successful, or happiness, is to reemerge from the other side of a challenge or sign of this experience, if my success in life came from a ability to a life with prosthetic or circumstances, or what people feel like my disability.
However, we're changed, we're marked, logically, by a challenge, physically or mentally both.
And I would say that's a good thing.
The adversity isn't a obstacle that we need to get to fix our lives.
It's part of our life.
And I tend to think that it's like my shadow.
Sometimes it's a lot of the time, but it's always with me.
And, of course, I wouldn't try to decline the impact, the weight of the person's suffering.
There are the adversity and challenges in life, and it's all true and it's true and it's not if you're having adversity or not, but as you're going to adversity.
So, our responsibility is not simply to protect people to us to protect people to us from the adversity, but to prepare them to the right way.
And let's make a damage to our children when we hear hear that they're not ready to adapt.
There's an important difference and distinction between the medical fact of being a person amputated and the subjective opinion of societies that I'm seeing a disabled or not.
And, in truth, the only disability that I had to deal with is if the world has ever thought I could be described from those words.
In our desire to protect those who we love to address a cold, dramatically about their medical projectors, or, really, really, the projects of their life expectancy, we have to be secure to not put the first morning in a wall that they're going to discovery.
Maybe the existing model to just look at what's broken in you and how to put it in the place, it can weaker the disease itself.
Don't treating a person in the complete, not to understand its potential, and we're creating a other illness to natural suffering that already have.
We're actually giving a vote to the value of a person in our community.
So we've got to see through the disease of human capability.
and, much more importantly, there's a relationship between those injuries to perceive and our creativity.
So, it's not by the way, or denial, or deny, these numbers of the things that we want to avoid or purpose, but rather find those opportunities in a accident.
So maybe the idea I want to explain to you is that there's no thing like to overcome an adversity, as well as you learn to use it, to use it, to use a term of fighting free, maybe even draging on the libone, maybe even dancing with us.
And maybe, if we look at an accident like a natural thing and useful, and we're less suspended by his presence.
This year, let's celebrate the dough of Charles Darwin, and it's 150 years ago, when I write on evolution on evolution, that Darwin has illustrated, I think, the truth at the end of the human prison.
To say it in another way, it's not the stronger than survive, and it's not even the smarter, it's not even the smarter, it's not the smarter, it's not even the smarter, it's not the stronger, and it's not the stronger than the milker, and it's not the stronger, it's not the stronger than the clever, and it &aims that's the higher, and it's what more.
The conflict is the genesis of crazy.
From Darwin, among the other things, we can recognize that the human ability to survive and develop has led from the suffering of human spirit through human spirit.
So again, transformation, adaptation, is our largest quality.
And perhaps, we're not going to go to evidence, we don't know what we're made.
Maybe that's what's gives us the adversity, a sense of your force.
So, we can take a gift.
We can imagine the adversity as something more than it's more difficult.
Maybe we can see it as a change.
The adversity is a change that we don't adapted to us yet.
I think the largest adversity that we created is this idea of normal normal idea. Now, who is this idea of normal now?
There's a normal, there's a typical, there's a typical.
And would you want to meet those poor people who were there?
I don't think right.
If we could change this paradigm from one of how to get the normality to a possibility, or potentiality, to be even a little bit more dangerous, we can understand the force of so many children, and inviting them to bring their valuable capacity with the community.
The anthropologists teaches us that what we, as humans, we've always wanted to the members of the community is to be to help, to contribute.
There's a evidence that in the Netherlands, 60,000 years ago, they would take the old and the subjects with preserves and the subjects with prevalence of these people were the value of the community, and the survival of these people were the value of the community: They didn't see these people like rarian and value.
A few years ago, I was in a citizen market where I grew up in the northwest of Pennsylvania.
and I was pleasant to a pomode.
It was extremely and I had trains of pants.
I heard this guy, his voice behind me saying, "but, it's not Aimee Mullins." And I turned out, and there's this guy's this man of half.
And I said, "Scusi ladies, let's live? I don't remember that I've ever meet." He said, "but," I didn't remember I met.
I mean, when we met us, I was going to hide from your mother. "
Risate Oh, that guy.
And, but certainly, I played a camel.
That gentleman was the Dr. Kean, a man I had known only from my mother on that day, because clear, clearly, I came to back in two weeks.
And so, the ecologist of my mother had gone in vacation, so the man who made me hidden was a complete stranger for my parents.
And because I was born without the peron, and I had the fingers, some fingers in this foot, and some of the fingers in this foot, and some of that, he had to be the messengaged.
He said, "I had to give this talk to your parents that you won't walk, and you'd never had the kind of mobility that have kids or no independent, and you've given me to me from then," Risate Apusi. The extraordinary thing was told me that he kept in my childhood, that I'd won't walk through my school, an born on the words,
that I had marched with the Girl Scout, you know, the Halloween't won't won my studio, or all of my studio, or all of my sporal lives, and they used it, teaching to the students of the medical school of Hahenemy and Hershey.
And he's called this part of the course, the X, the potential of human will.
There's no projects can hold as a retail can be and how determining in the quality of life of a person's life's life's life's lives.
And the Ph.D.D. continued to explain me and he said, "In my experience, unless they didn't sell it, and even if it's left to a bricie of support, if it's just a baby."
You see Dr. Kean changed his opinion changed his opinion.
It understood that there's a difference between a medical condition and what each can do with it.
And there's been a change in my thinking during the years, in this, if you were asked me when I was 15 years old, if I had to have a second.
I used that kind of normality at that time.
If you ask it today, I'm not sure.
And it's because of the experiences that I had with them, not for the experiences that I had with them.
and maybe, the change in me, because I've been exposed to the most of the people who have open the door of the people who have opened me.
You can see, everything you need is a person that you're showing you the epiphania of your pots, and you're going to give someone to the chiavoid of their strength, and you're going to get a door for someone at a crucial moment, you're educating the best ways.
You're teaching them to open the doors itself.
in fact, the meaning of the word educate is from the rade "extract" which means, pull out what it's inside, to bring the potential.
So again, what's the potential that we want to pull out?
There's been a case in the 1960s in Grand break, when they were passing from the school school schools.
It's called the proof continuity, "let's call it" inequality here in the United States.
it means to separate students dependently dependently.
And the students with the best votes have a harder, and teachers, better, that's made for a period of three months, Ai students with the insufficient vote, "they were smart.
And at the end of this period of three months, they were having the results of the results of "great." And, of course. "And," they were "insufficient." And that "insufficient." And this is what happened to the end of the three months.
Those who had been in school, beyond the ones that I'd leave.
The crucial part of this study was that even the teachers were decept.
The teachers didn't know it was done this change.
He's just been telling: These are the very good students, and these are the ones with unsufficient.
And so it's how they started teaching them.
So, I think the real disability is to have a damaged damaged, and a spirit of damage has not hope.
You can't see the beauty.
It doesn't have our natural, infant curiosity and our innate capability to imagine.
If we can support the human spirit to maintain hope, to see the beauty of yours and in others, to be imaginative and curious, to be imaginative and curious, although we're using our force correctly.
When the spirit has these quality, we can create new reality and new ways of being.
I'd like to leave you with a poet written from a poet, and it got me to know my friend Jacques Demboard.
and the poem is called "The God that only knows four words," Every child has met God, not the NO, but the God of NO, but the God, but the God of NO, but the God that only knows four words and continues to repeat me.
Thank you.

Skiller years ago, here at TED, Petere Skillman introduced a challenge of design called the marshmallow.
And the idea is very simple.
Great four people have to build the higher torre can be able to get the highest way that you can reach from sole, using 20 spaghetti, a meter of spring and a marshmallow.
The marshmallow has to the top of the tower.
And even though it looks very simple, actually, it's pretty difficult, because it costring people to collaborate very quickly.
And so I thought it was an interesting idea, and I've empowered it in a lab on design.
And it was a huge successful.
And since then, I've been organized about 70 labs of the world with students, designers and architects, even directors and architects, even Fortunes of research and Fortune 50.
There's something in this exercise that reveals about the nature of collaboration, and I'd like to share some of these lessons with you.
Normally, most of the people are starting with orienting the task.
They're talking, you imagine what it might have, they're competing for the power, then they spend time planning, organizing.
They're going to make sketches.
They're going to take most of the time disposition assembling the crop and, at the end, just when the time is scade, someone coming out the marshmallow, and they do a step back and Ta-!
They're working.
But what's really going on, most of the time, is that the "Ta-" turns into a" Uh-oh, "because the weight of the marshmallow does the whole structure.
There's a number of people who have more moments "uh-oh," and in the worst of the other people's worse in business school.
They put it, cheat, they're district, and they create structures absolutely transballoners.
And there's obviously groups that have more structures that have a lot more structures structures, and, the best, there are the unchildhood schools.
And it's incredible.
As Peter says, not just create the highest structures, but they're also the highest structures.
And your question is, how can it be? Why? Why do it? Why have particular?
And Peter love to say that, "No one of the kids spent time trying to become the Spahetti SpA." Right. "Right." Right. "I'm.
They don't spend time competing for power.
But there's also a other reason.
And the reason is that the students are formed to find the individual best project.
And then you go.
And after, what's happening is that when they put the marshmallow in the top, they don't have time, and what happens?
The crisis.
Do it sounds familiar? Right.
What kids do differently, is that start from the marshmallow, and they build prototypes, one after the other, keeping, and they've got to fix prototyping traballing along the walk.
The designers recognize that this kind of collaboration is the essence of the process of iterative.
And with every version, children have an instantaneous feedback on what works and it doesn't work.
So the ability to work on prototyping is essential, but see how they work.
The media for most people is about about 50 centrimeters, for the students of economy, about half, lawyers, a better bit, but not very, better, better than adults.
Who's better everyone?
Architects and engineers, thank you.
99 cm is the highest structure that I've ever seen.
And why? Because they understand that triangles and the geometric geometric models are the key to build stable.
And then we have the general directors, a better bit of the media.
But here's where it gets interesting.
If you include an administrator, the group can do much better.
It's amazing. It's going around, you look at "Vedrai that that the group win" You can see the ancient. "And why?
Because they have particularly the ability to evolve the job.
They get the process, they understand it.
And all the groups that run and pay attention to the work will improve significant the team of the results of the team.
special and the dots of agevolation, and their combination bringing a safe successful.
If you have 10 groups that are usually working well, you'll probably have six that they're going to be able to be structures.
And I tried an interesting experiment.
And I thought, let's go up for a time.
I've put 10,000 dollars in software at the wind.
What do you think that's successful to students?
What was the results?
Here's what happened.
No one of the team created a stable structure.
If one of them had built a 2.5 cm, it would take a 2.5 cm, it would take my premise.
It's not interesting that a very strong impacts?
We tried again again again the exercise with the students.
What do you think this happened?
They've understood the value of a prototype.
The same team, the worse has become the best.
They've created the higher structure in the lower.
And so they're important lessons about nature of incentives and successful. You might then ask you, why should anybody spend the time writing a marshmallow?
The reason is this: help to create digital tools and processing to help groups, video games and effects.
And what a marshshmallow is to help to identify the hidden assumptions.
Because, honestly, every project has the marshmallow, is it doesn't it?
The challenge provides a shared experience, a common language, a common position to build a prototype.
And so, this is the value of the experience, of this simple exercise.
And those of you were interested, it can go to marshmallowing.
It's a blog where you can give a look at how to build marshmallow.
There's a step for step for step.
There's crazy examples from all over the world like people's correct the system.
There's also the world record.
And the most important lesson, I think, is that design is really a contact of contact.
It requires the employment of all the senses, and the use of most final reasonments, feelings and the manufacturing and the manufacturing that you have in hand.
And sometimes, a small prototype of this experience is all what's necessary to transform a moment, "uh-oh" at a moment. "
And all that can make a difference.
Thank you very much.
So let's have a machine, great, great, beautiful, in the TED style, is a time machine.
Everybody in this room have to go.
You can go back, you can't get where you're.
And I'd be curious to know what you would choose, because I asked my friends in the last time, and everybody wants to go back.
I don't know. They want to go back to before there were the car or Twitter, or "American Idol."
I don't know.
I think there's sort of convinced that there's a kind of return to the visual.
I understand it.
But I'm not part of that group, I have to admit.
I don't want to go back, and not because I'm adventurous, it's because I'm going forward.
So I want to go into the machine and I want to go on.
This is the best time that we have been on this planet in every field that we can measure: health, wealth, mobility, mobility, mobility, mobility, mobility, chance, mobility,
There's never been a period like this.
My grandparents died, everybody, before the 60 years old.
My grandparents were spent that number at 70.
My parents are to touch.
So it's better that's a nine at the beginning of my death.
But it's not just people like us, it's a much bigger than this.
A child born in New Delhi can do today can expect to live as much as the richer man in the world of 100 years ago.
Think about it. It's an amazing fact.
How does it be true?
It's a little bit. The pool has killed billion people on this planet.
It changed the demography of the global population as no one has ever done.
If he went. I go. I wish.
We've defeed it. Audience.
In the rich world, diseases that threatened millions of people just a generation ago, they don't exist.
His, rosolitself, polio --
someone still knows what they're?
Vaccines, modern medicine, our ability to feed billions of people, these are triumph of the scientific method.
And in me, the scientific method, try the things, to see if they work, change when they don't work, it's one of the big results of humanity.
These were the good news.
Unfortunately, they were the only good news because there are other problems, and they were cited many times, for example, one of them is that, despite all we got, a billion people go on this planet, every day.
This number is growing, with incredible rapidity, and it's green.
And not only, we used our creativity to fill the planet.
It's a potable land, rainforests, rainforests, natural gas: they're disappearing, and they're going, and if we don't see our actions to get out of this guess, we're going to be able to be able.
So the question is, can we do this? I think of it.
I think it's clear that it's possible to make food to feed billions of people who live on.
And I think it's possible to reprovide this world of energy without this.
I really believe it, and no, it's not a plan illusion.
But here's the thing I've got the night -- one of the things I'm holding the night.
We've never need to be so needed scientific progress as we need to do now, and we've never been in the position of using them as we could today.
We're an incredibly step from very incredible events, really, in many ambites.
But despite this, I think we should go back centuries, 300 years old, before Illuminism, to find a time where we fought the progress, a period of time we fought to the progress, a period where we do now.
People are trapped in what they believe, and they do with a lot of strength that we can't get liberate.
In the truth, it can be free.
Listen, everybody has rights to their opinion; they've even even right to the opinion, but you know what don't you?
You don't even have a facts. I'm sorry, you can't.
I put it a little bit to understand it.
A decine years ago I wrote a story about the New Yorker vaccines for "The New Yorker," an article.
And I was amazing that someone opposite, which was contrary to what it is, after all, the measure of public health health care of the whole human history.
I didn't know what to do, so I've been writing the story, and I spent another.
Not much later, I've written a story about genetically modified food.
States thing, just bigger.
People were impaired.
So I've written a story about that, and I couldn't understand why people consider the OGM like "food show," because they thought that moved specific molecules, rather than to get the work of nature.
But, as always, I'm doing my job. I wrote the story and I went forward.
I mean, I'm a journalist: Let's go down, go down there.
But these stories were tortured and I couldn't understand why, but at the end of it.
The problem was that those fanatics that were doing crazy, they weren't at all.
They were people of consciousness, education, people for good.
They were just like people in this room.
And the thing was very disturbing --
but then I thought, we need to be honest; we're at a point, on this planet, where we don't have the same relationship with the progress in the same way that there was once.
We're talking about the change.
We're talking in terms of ironic terms of using virgolette, "All right," OK, there's a reasons to do it, and I think we know what they are.
We have lost trust in institutions, in authority, and sometimes in the science itself, and it's understanding that it's successful.
It's just just a few names and people understand.
Chernobyl, Bhopal, Challenger, Vioxx, weapons of mass, election election.
I mean, each one has his list.
We have questions and problems with the people we thought we were always right.
So you're skeptical.
Do you ask, pretend of evidence.
You don't give nothing for grass.
But here's the fundamental point: when the evidence come is necessary, and we're not very good in this.
And I think that the reason is that we're in an epidemic that I've never seen and I've never seen.
About 12 years ago, he published a story, a very horrible story, which was supported of autism and and vaccines against disease against disease, parods and rosoly.
Very frightening.
Hundreds of studies were made to see if it was true.
And you had to do hundreds of studies; it's a important issue.
And then they got the data.
They came from the United States, from the U.K., from the Sweden, from Canada, and everybody were equal, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no correlation, no.
It didn't have a difference. It didn't do it because we think about the anecdots, to what we think of seeing, what it makes us hear.
We don't believe a plant documents of the government employees that show us numbers, and I understand it, and I understand that, I think we all understand it.
But you know what?
The results were devastating --
devastating because this is a fact: The United States are one of the few countries in the world where the number of vaccines against the world in which the number of vaccines against the morning.
It's horrible, and we're going to be going to be able to be ourselves.
It's terrible.
What happened is that happened you to do something like this?
Now, I understand it. I understand it really.
Think about it, someone here has the disease?
Anyone of the audience has never seen a person died of morning?
It doesn't happen.
In this country doesn't happen, but it's 160,000 times in the world last year.
I'm a lot of dead dead for bills, 20 every hour.
But since that it didn't happen here, we can take it from your head, and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around to shooting messages and ignorance from palcoscenes like Oprah or Larry King Live.
And they can do it because they can't understand the difference between causality and correlation.
They don't understand that these two things seem like the same, but they're not going to be.
But it's something that we need to learn, and we need to learn to learn it quickly.
This man was a hero, Jonas Salk.
He's released the humanity from one of its worse.
No fear, no fear, no suffering -- the polio, puff --
The man at the center, not as well.
It's called Paul Offit.
He just created a vaccine against the rotats together with other people.
It saved 400, 500 thousand children every year in developing countries.
Is that bad, right?
It's good, if it wasn't that Paul goes around to speak of vaccines, says how valuable people and that should just stop.
And he says in these terms.
So Paul is considered a terrorist.
When Paul: When Paul talks in a public humor can't be tested without an armed armed.
They call it home because they love some people like reminded to know where his children go to school.
Why? Because Paul has created a vaccine.
I wouldn't need to tell it, but vaccines are fundamental.
If we're taking them, diseases come back, terrible diseases, and it's going on.
We've got the bills in this country.
And it's going to be worse, and among not the children will commit again, because it's just a question of numbers.
And they're not just going to die.
The polio? Let's get to take it. Why not?
One of my former college who wrote a couple of weeks ago, and he told me that I was considered a little bit of except.
Nobody told me before.
She wouldn't vaccinated with polio.
It's even death.
OK.
Why? Because there's no polio from us. But you know what?
We had no polio in the United States.
Today I don't know -- maybe you're having a guy's gone to an airplane in Lagos and it's coming to Los Angeles, right now.
Maybe they're going to land in a couple hours, it's going to see a machine, that's here in Long Beach and they're going to go to Long Beach, and they're going to be a couple of hours,
He doesn't know that I've been infected by a paralyzing disease, and we don't even know it, because it's how the world works.
This is the planet where we live. We don't do until it's.
We love to surrounding us. Let's do that.
You know, you've got the staminkin?
Echinky, a little bit of antioxydating to start the day.
I know you've done this because half of the American Americans do this every day.
They take that stuff stuff, as they rate to the alternative medicine, and it doesn't matter how often they're going to do that stuff.
The data is always demonstrates it.
They make the urinner. The more of this is not doing, almost never.
But it's okay, you want to spend 28 billion dollars per urinning, I'm with you!
Urina. It's cure.
Why do we do that? Why?
I think we're looking at the big drug houses.
Let's see the great governance. We don't trust us.
And let's do well. Our healthcare system.
It's cruel to millions of people.
It's absolutely, incredibly cold and demoralizing for those of us that can afford.
So we're scape away, and who are we going to refugee?
We're alone between the arms of the big placebo.
It's great. We love the big placebo.
You know, it's a serious problem because this stuff is a slavor, and we spend billions of dollars.
I have a bunch of examples here.
No one of these knee kgo -- a frode, echinacea -- a frode, echinacy -- I don't know what it's, but it's a fraud.
You know what? When I tell these things, people I'm telling them, people me against it, and they say, "But what's interested in? Law that people do what they want.
It's good. "
You know what? You're going back.
Because I don't care if it's the secret of Department for the Service and the Service and the Service, I don't want to listen to the evidence of the thermography of the experts on mography that wants to treat the patients with the coffee.
When we imboard the street that brings to remit science and evidence with magic and tradition, we end in a place where we wouldn't want to be.
Let's do like Thabo in South Africa.
It killed 400 mile of its concitizens continuing to say that bars, cutting and the success of the anti-retroviral drugs that we know can slowing the meeting of the AIDS.
Hundreds of thousands of inuseful deaths in a nation that was more than every other than this disease.
Please, you don't tell me that there are no consequences for these.
There are. There are always.
Now, the most stupid epidemic that we are in the middle right now is the war's resurd between the war's supported in the middle of the biological food.
It's an idiot. It's got to end.
It's a diatrist on the words, on the metaphor.
It's ideology, it's not science.
Every single thing we eat, every chick of rise, every chick of the resilience, every Bruxells of Brxelles was modified by the man.
You can see, they didn't have sent in the garden of Eden.
There were no melanzees.
There were no even Christmas trees. We created them.
We've done this over the last 1111,000 years.
Something worked and something worked and something else.
And we've eliminated what was not working.
Now we can do it more precise.
And there are some risks, of course, there are.
But we can put things like vitamin A in the resers, and this would help millions of people, prolying their life.
And we don't want to do that?
I've got to tell you, I don't understand it.
We're contrary to the OGM.
Why?
The things that I'm always feeling: too many chemicals, pesticides, hormones, we don't want to be huge crops with the same thing, is wrong.
We don't want the company to put patents on life.
We don't want the company to be uniquetaries are uniquetary.
You know what's my answer to this?
It's yes. You're right. Let's.
It's true, we have a huge food problem, but it's not science.
It has nothing to do with science.
It's law, morality, morality, the patents.
You know that science is not a corporation.
It's not a nation.
It's not even an idea; it's a process.
It's a process, sometimes it's a process, sometimes it's idea that we wouldn't allow us to do this science, because we're afraid is really swing to millions of people to prohope.
You know, in the next 50 years we're going to be forced to produce 70 percent of the food in more than we produce now, 70 percent.
These are the investments in Africa in the last 30 years.
Vergognose.
They need and we don't need them.
Why? His genetically modified.
We don't want to encourage people to eat eat at least like the manioca.
I've got a billion people eat it.
It looks a little bit.
But it gives it only calories. It's slave.
It's not nutrients, it doesn't have protein, but scientists are found how to put it in this moment.
And so many people could eat the least the risk of becoming blind.
They wouldn't die for hunger, and you know what?
It would be very good. It's not a restaurant, but it would be very good.
I can ask myself myself myself, why are we against?
I mean, let's say, let's do we're doing this?
Just why don't we want to move genes and there?
It's about moving genes. It's not about chemicals.
It's not about our ridiculous obsession for hormones, or our desire to have bigger food, better.
There's no Krispies.
It's about saving people's life, and it would now start to understand what it means.
Because -- if we don't understand it? -- if we don't understand it, and we're going to be blaming, and we're going to be able to throw ourselves, technological colonizing.
There's no other way of describe what's going on.
It's selfish, it's in front of us, and we have to stop it.
So, after this conversation, you could ask me, "Would you want to go into this redier," Do you want to go into this restore of time and go to the future? "
Of course I want.
It's stuck on the present now, but we have an incredible opportunity.
We can put the machine of time as we want.
We have the chance of going where we want, and we're going to really go where we want.
We need to do these conversations, and we need to think, but when we enter the car of time and we go forward to do it.
I know that we can and, as it's about, I think the world of it right now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
One day, the chronist of Los Angeles Times Steve Lopez was walking for the streets of the center of Los Angeles when he heard a beautiful music.
He came from a man, a man, an African-American man, fascinating, fascinating, without dimora, who played a violin which had only two cords.
I'm telling a story that many of you know, because the Steve services for the cage of a book, which, in the process of a book, which, in the process, with Robert Downey Jr who interpret the part of the Steve Lopez, and Jamie Foxel at the part of the Nathaniel Anony Ayers, the constant to the Juilliard to the Juilliard who's a paranoid to the slavery.
Nathaniel leave the Juilliard, he had an unnervous exhaul, and 30 years later she lived as a without a roof for the streets of Skid Row in the center of Los Angeles.
I'm all of you to read the book of Steve or looking at the movies to understand not just the beautiful legacacaces that created between these two men,
My name is Jane McGonigal. I'm a game author.
And I'm going to have 10 years old, and my goods for the next 10 years is to try to make easy to save the world in the world of online games.
To do that I have a plan, and it's in me, and in convincing more people, including more time to play play playing more and more beautiful, interesting.
We're three billion hours at the time we're playing online.
Some of you might think, "It's a lot of time playing."
even too long, looking at how many urgent problems we need to solve the real world.
In fact, in my research, at the Istitute for the Futuro, actually is the contrary.
Three billion hours a week are not less enough to solve the most urgent problems in the world.
In fact, I think that if we want to survive the next century on this planet, we need to increase remarkable.
I've calculated that the total we need is 21 billion hours every week.
It's probably a counterintuitive point, so the repeat, so the repeat, to reinforce the concept.
If we want to solve that hunger, poverty, the global conflicts, global conflicts, the obesity, I think we need to have the ambition to play online, for at least 21 billion hours, for the end of the next decade. No, I'm really serious.
That's why. This picture is a picture of reassume because I think that's so important for the survival of the species.
This is a portrait of the Phil Toldan's photographer, wanted to capture the emotion of the game.
So she photographed the players as they were playing.
And that's a classic emotional class.
If you're not abitual players is possible that you're losing some of this picture.
You can probably notice the sense of urgency, a little bit of fear, but also an intention to a very difficult problem.
If you're players, you'll notice some details, and around the mouth is a sign of optimism.
And the eyebrown eyebroken.
This is an abitual player a step from something called a "Exics" Vittory. "
Ah, it's a term that you've heard. Okay.
And so we have the abitual players between us.
A epic victory is such a positive result that seems to be so extraordinarily positive that you don't seem to when you don't get it.
It's almost beyond imagination, and when you get a shock to discover what you're capable. This is an epic victory.
This player is a step from an ep-toy lives.
And this is the expression that we need to see about millions of resolved problems in the world as we face the obstacles of the world as well as well as the expression of someone who, against all the expectations, against all the expectations, it's a step from a vittory.
Unfortunately, this is the expression that we see in life of all the day while we're treating in the lives of the urgents.
That's the expression that I call "I'm not Brate in the Reality." And I'm going to do it.
I'm not Bring expression "I'm not Bring Nella Reality."
This is a graffite in my old neighborhood of Berkeley, in California, where I did the PhD on why we're more good at the game in the real game.
And that's a problem of many abitual players: we feel that we're not good as well as in games.
And I don't mean "good" just like "success", "even though, it's part of this: we get more results in online worlds.
But I'm also saying "good" in the sense of motivated, to work and cooperate.
And when we're in an online world, I think that many of us become the best versions of ourselves, the more capable of helping, more capable of focus on a problem for all the time, to get up after a failure and try again.
And in the real life, when we face a failure, when we face a failure, often we don't feel so, we don't feel so, we feel anxious, maybe depressed, even depress, frustrated or movie.
We're not trying to get these feelings, and they just don't exist in a game.
So this is what I wanted to study to university.
So what is that in a game is that we can't get any result?
How can we lead those feelings and applications in the real world?
So I studied with games like World of Warcraft, which is really the ideal environment to solve collaborative problems.
And I started to notice some things that make the lives so possible in the online worlds.
The first is that, when you look in one of these online games, especially in the World of Warcraft, and there are many different characters that they've got a mission to rescue the world. Fin the right right now.
But not any mission: a perfectly mission to your current current level in the game. Right?
So you can complete it.
They don't have a challenge.
But it's the limit of your ability. So you have to do seriously.
But there's no socupation in the World of Warcraft, you don't spend the time turning to turn, there's always something specific and important to do.
And there's a lot of collaborators.
Whatever you're, hundreds of thousands of people, ready to join your mission.
It's not a common thing in real life, this feeling that we have a lot of collaborators.
And there's this narrative storm, this narrative that inspire, and what we're there, and what we're doing.
And then we get this positive feedback --
You've heard of increasing and a strength of a strength, and a intelligence.
We don't get that kind of constant feedback in real life.
When I leave this stage, I won't have one to talk to a audience, and throw one in ideas.
I don't get that type of feedback in real life.
Now, the problem of collaborative environments online as the World Warcraft is that it so much satisfaction is that it so much satisfying to be to a step from an epic vittory, all the moments, we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds.
It's just better than reality.
It's why, now, collectively all the World Warcraft players spent 5.93 million years to solve Azeroth virtual problems.
That's not necessarily a negative thing.
But let's put it in perspective: 5.93 million years ago was the time when one of our ancestors raw up.
That's the first one to walk.
Okay, so when we're talking about how we're investing in playing, the only way even thinking about it, is to speak of human times, which is to go to the human evolution, which is just a extraordinary, but also, because we found that passing all this time to play, we're changing what we can do, we're changing what we can, we're doing to work more heart.
This is true, I think.
So, you're talking about this interesting statistics.
It was recently published by a researcher at Carnagie Mellon.
The average young medium today in a country with a strong town's culture with a strong town, it's 21-year-old players.
10,000 hours is a number of decision for two reasons.
First of all, for children in the United States 10.080 hours is the exact number of hours that I passes to school from the room to the elementary room, until every day,
So, we have a whole way of parallel education that young people learn how to be the good players ♪ in the time in school in which they learn everything else.
And some of you have probably read the new book of Malcolm Gladwell, "Fuoriclasse."
If you've read it's theory of his success, the theory of the 10,000 hours for success.
It's founded on a very good research in the cognition, which says that if we're demand that if we're going to be genes in that field.
We're going to be good in that something as the best people in the world.
So what we have now now is a whole generation of young people who are the genes of play.
So, the question is, "Exactly, what's going on."
because if we could understand what's happening we'd be disposition of the amount of unprecedenting.
That's the number of people in the world that are at least a day to play online.
These are our game genes.
500 million of people who are extraordinarily brave -- in something.
And in the next decade, we're going to have another billion.
If you already don't know it, that's what you expect: the video game industry is developing platforms that a little energy and work with the cell cell network instead of the Internet to band cosystem cosystem to the world, in particular in India, China, Brayle, have a few online.
And it's a billion player in the next decade.
This is going to bring us to 1.5 billion players.
So I started to think about what games are transforming us into genes.
These are four aspects that I've been individuals. The first one is a good urgent.
Okay. Think of that as a form of self-motivation.
A optimism is the wish to act immediately to address an obstacle, together with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success.
The abitual players believe that an ep-toy, and it's just possible and value it's time to try, and try right now.
The abitual players don't do with hands.
The abitual players are virtuous in the tbeing a robust in social.
There's a lot of interesting research that show how we're better people after they've played with other people after playing with them, even though they've been played with them.
And the reason is that it takes a lot of trust to play with someone: we have trust that they're going to spend their time with us, who will play with the same rules and the same obbieces, and they will remain to the conclusion of the game.
So, playing together that made the lead of trust and cooperation.
We have more robust social relationships.
I love.
You know, there's one reason why the World Warcraft of Warcraft play 22 hours a week, almost as a job.
It's because we know, as we're playing, that we're actually happily happily working, rather than relassing us or losing time.
We know that we're optimized, as a human, to work on something that has meaning.
And the abitual players are willing to work constantly, if it's assigned a task.
And to finish, a epic meaning.
The abitual players love to be associated with wonderful missions, of human stories about scale.
For example, a small information to help create context.
You all know Wikipedia, the largest wiki in the world.
The second wiki wiki's largest wiki of the World Warcraft of Warcraft Cinque million people use it every month.
They got a bunch more information on the World of Warcraft in the Internet, that on any other issue in any other wiki in the world.
They're building an epic opera.
They're building a foundation of the World of Warcraft.
Okay, these are the four superpowers that together together together, one thing.
The abitual players are great dotes of super-powers.
These are people who believe they're individually capable of change the world.
The only problem is they believe that they're capable of change the virtual worlds, but not that real.
This is the problem that I'm trying to solve.
There's an economy called Edward Castronova.
His studies are brilliant. It's studying the reason why people invest so much time, energy and money, in online worlds.
He says, "We're looking at the least that's nothing to the exoh of mass and toward the virtual towards the virtual and the environments of game."
And it's a economic, so it's rational, and he says -- not like me, I'm a game designer, I'm exubering --
But he says that this is a perfectly sensed that this is a perfectly sensus, because the abitual players can get more in the online worlds that in real life.
They can have more solid social relationships in a game that's not in the real life.
They need a better feedback and they hear more reward in a game that doesn't live in the real life.
So, say, now, it's perfectly reasonably for the players, to spend more time in virtual worlds that in the real world. I agree that this is reasonable, but right now, no one situation, but it's not, a ideal situation.
Here, I've been inspiration from something that's 2500 years ago.
These are dads, made of pecora Prime to have a joyhots, and we had wonderful bones of peak, and we had bones of peak out of humanity.
If you know, you know, the written of the ancient Greek, maybe you know, this story.
It's the story of who invented the games and why.
And I've been told by the playing, particularly dadi, they were invented in the Lidia, during a period of load.
It was so several, that the king of the Lidia decided to do something impencil.
People had to have a lot of the population was in riched, they needed a extreme solution.
So, according to Erodoto, invented the games of dads and they emanded a very valid.
One day, they would all eat.
The next day, everybody would play.
And they immersed so deeply in dade games, from the moment that play is so engaged, and they immers in a state of games, which ignored the fact that they had nothing to eat.
And so one day they were playing, and one day.
And according to Erodote, I went up to 18 years, surviving the bearing of the beat at one day and playing that next.
I think that's exactly the way we use games at the day.
We use games to escape of the real world suffering.
We use the games to get away from all of this that doesn't work in our real environment, from all that we don't satisfying us of real life, and we get what we need from games.
But we don't need to stop here.
That's really interesting: according to Erodote, after 18 years, the primary of the primary of the prise of dadi.
They became the whole kingdom in half, they played a dadi, and the winners of that participate who participate in an epic participation.
They'd go and they went to search of a new land where to live, and left behind the good enough of people to survive with the resources, with the hoping of their civilization somewhere else, where they could could try.
It's a little bit of a little bizarre, right?
Recently, though, DNA revealed that the Etruses who would then bring to the rohands, shared the same DNA of the anties of the people in the Lidia.
And so recently, scientists have suggested that the story of Erodote is a real story.
And geologists have found evidence of a global cooling of a global cooling almost 20 years and that could explain the primary.
So this incredible story might be true: they could actually have been rescue of their culture playing, refugees in games for 18 years, and then be so inspired, and know how to come up with the game to rescue the whole civilization.
Okay, we can do that even.
Let's go to Warcraft since 1994.
It was the first game in real time strategy of World Warcraft. This 16 years ago.
And they were played for 18 years, we've played in Warcraft for 16 years.
I say, we're ready for our game.
And they would half the population in the journey of the world.
It's from here that I've got the idea of 21 billion hours.
So let's show that half of us can agree to get an hour a day to play, until we solve the real world's problems.
I imagine what you're to ask, "How do we solve the real problems of the real world in a game?" Well, this is what I've been dedicated for my job in the last last several years, present Istage.
In our offices of Palo Alto have this express our own idea of how we should relate with the future.
We don't want to try to predict the future.
So what we want to do is to make -- the future.
We want to imagine the scenario from the best results and then we want to give people chance to the possibility to the people to actually transform them.
We want to imagine victories and then give people the tools to make them.
I'm going to show you briefly three games that I'm an attempt to people to make the tools to make the tools to create victories in their future.
This is "Petrolio."
We've made this game in 2007.
It's an online game in which is looking for survive to survive a oil.
The charity isn't real, but we've published enough material to make it online, and to make life real as if we were in the severe. So, when you go into the game, you get there, including us in which area, and dopodichids you, and we give you news video in real time, data, showing exactly the cost of oil, the things that's not available, the cost of the distribution of food.
the impact on the transportation, if the schools are clear, if there's rich, and you have to think about how you live your life if this is real. Dopodim, we ask you to have a blog to publish, to publishing pictures -- to publish pictures -- to publish pictures pictures -- to publish pictures -- to publish pictures -- to publish pictures pictures -- to publish pictures pictures pictures -- to publish pictures pictures pictures...
We've got this game with 1,700 players in 2007, and we've observed them from then for the three years, and what I can say is that it's a experience that transforms.
Nobody wants to change the way that they're just because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing for the world or because it's.
But if they immerged them in an epic and say, "We don't have any oil.
This is an incredible story! A story that you can join.
It's yourself to see how to survive. "
Most of our players then kept the habits that learned in the game.
So, for the next game to save the world, we decided to save the world, and we decided to a larger problem of oil.
We made a game called Superstruct, at the Istitute for the Future, and the premise was: a supercomputer calculated that the humanity has only 23 years on this planet.
The supercomputer was called "Sistema" the Global Estination. "Of course." Of course.
And we asked people to come online almost like in a Jerry Bruckheimer's film.
You know Jerry Bruckheimer, formers a team from dream: There's an astronauty, the scientist, the galaxy, and they all have something to do to save the world, but in our game, instead of having only only only only five people in the team from the team, all the way to the team from dream, and it's a part of dream, and it's on your future of health and the future of previity, the future of health and the future of security.
8,000 people have played for eight weeks, they've generated 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can find if you go online and looking for Google "Superstruct."
And finally, the last game, will start the three. This is a game with the three. This is a game with the Istitute of the World Bank.
If you complete the game will be certificate from the World Bank, as the Social Bank, as the Social Innovator, class of 2010.
As we work with sub-Saharan Africa, we're inviting them to learn the techniques of social innovation.
There's a smoking story, you're increases of a level of the local knowledge, collaboration, sustainability, imagination and inventive.
I'm inviting all you to share this game with young people, everywhere in the world, particularly in the developing world, particularly in the developing world, which might be benefit from the way to join the world.
It's now to conclude.
I want to ask a question.
What do you think that's going to happen?
We have all these incredible players, we have these games that are plants of what we could do, but none of those who still have rescued the real world.
Well, I hope you can agree with me that the abitual players are a human resources that we can use to do work in the real world, that games are a powerful platform for the change, that we have these incredible superpowers, a real platform for the change, that we have these incredible superpowers, a very good robust.
And I really hope that we can come in to play with games that have important important, to survive on this planet for another century, and my hope is that I's unized you to join me in making and participate with games like this.
When I look forward to the decade, of two things are certain: that we can make any future we can imagine, and that we can play any future we can imagine, and we can play any game.
So, I say, let's start to the games that will change the world.
Thank you.
For some time, I've been interested in the placebo effect, it may look like a strange thing that a magician if you do, at least, not considered it from my point of view that, which is, "something fake" In other words, the pills of the glum, the gar effect of studies, the searching effect, just because the person thinks,
that what's happening is to a drug or something like that --
The therapy of the pain, for example, if they believe that they're going to have a measurable effect in the body called placebo.
Something thing about becomes true for the perception that if it has.
To understand, I'm going to show you a magical trick, very simple.
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick that is in all the books for children in the 1919191950s.
I learned it only with Cub Scout Magic in the 'in the' 60s.
And so I'll explain it for you and so I'll explain it.
And so I'm going to explain why I've explained you.
That's what happens.
The knife, you can look at.
I'm going to just the knife in my clear, so.
I'm on the manics.
It's to be safe or safe to be safe.
I'm weird like this.
How you can see that you can ever do something. It's just going to go on or down from my manics.
And the purpose of this is simple.
I go to open my hand, and if it's all gone well, my animal magnetism will track the knife.
In fact, I'm actually going to go to the place, and the knife don't fall.
Nothing on or down from my manics.
no trick. You can look at all.
Two!
That's a trick that often teach children.
that they're interested in the magic, because you can learn a lot about the thoky even though, it's very simple.
Many of you in this room will know.
That's what's going on in my hand.
I say that I'm going up my wrist.
to make sure that nothing goes up or down from my manica, this is a lie.
The reason I'm holding the wrist is because it's the secret of illusion.
And when my hand is moving away away from you, this fingers from you, this finger here, my indetection was, in a position that, and then!
There's someone who didn't have an childhood here.
It's like this, right here, right.
And when I also go around the fingers.
We can talk about why it's deception, because you don't just notice that there are just three fingers up there because the minds, and the way that we have the information, not count, one, two.
But that's not the point. Right? And when I open my hand, Of course, it's attached to not through the animal magnetism, but through the English magnetic, it's my own own indeception here.
And when I close my finger, same thing, when I go back, this movement covers the fingers.
My hand. The knife is away.
It's a trick you can do with your friends and neighbors. Thank you.
Now, what does this with the placebo effect?
I read a study, a year ago that's shown me.
I'm not a doctor or a researcher, so it was a surprising thing.
It looks like if you're a placebo in the shape of a white, made like an aspirin, just a white stroke, it's a stick.
But if you change the shape and you give the placebo, shape of a smaller pilly, and the blue of blue, and print a letter is more effective visibly.
Even if there's no drug -- they're pills.
But a white pill isn't as effective blue pill.
What? It really really did me.
But anyway, it's not here that end up.
The capsures are more effective of the crazy of any form.
A hit, which is yellow, which is yellow-to-up, and it's better than a capsule.
The dosage has a role.
A twice twice a day is not as effective as three pills -- now I don't remind the statistics. Scuse.
But the point is --
that these dosages have a role.
And it also has a role.
And if you want the definitive placebo you have to use a needle.
Right? A syringe with something -- a couple of c.c.c.c.c.c.din..
You inject it in a patient --
This is a picture so strong in their mind, much stronger of the white of the white of the pill.
It's real, this graph, I'm going to show another time when we're going to show another time.
The point is that the white pile is not effective as the blue that blue is not effective as the capsule, which is not effective as a needle.
And no one of these has a drug quality.
It's just your believe that makes them real in your own and race.
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and apply it to a magic trick.
And doing some of the trick and do that it looks like real.
And we know from the study that when you want a effect, you need to use the needle.
That's a fillon chickens, a lot of the thumb.
It's a little bit.
That's my meat. That's not special from Damian.
This is my skin. This is not a special hollywoods.
I'm going to drink my skin and get this way to the opposite part of the opposite.
If you try nausea -- if I get it easily -- I've done for some friends in the tree, the other night, and for some I didn't know, and a woman is almost sent.
So if you try nausea easily, suggesting that you don't look for the next 30s -- in fact, you know, I'll do the first part of this.
You can see, you can look at another side.
That's what's happening here, I'm going to the beginning of my arm I just do a little hole.
Sorry. Do you impression?
And now a little bit through my skin, and out of the other side, so that.
Now, we're in the same position that the trick of the knife.
More or not you can't count my fingers now, right?
So I'm showing you. Here's one, two, four, five. Yeah, well...
I know what people think when they see.
They think, "Sicurly won't be so stupid from the skin to just just a little bit of a little minute."
So, let me give you a beat.
How does it look? I mean.
Yeah, I know that there's going to say, "OK, I didn't see it well."
People in rooms are entering.
So let me show you from close.
This is really my skin. It's not a special effect of Hollywood.
This is my meat, and I can turn it around.
You're feeling like you're going to look from another, you don't look.
People at the bottom or they're going to look at the video to say, "Well, it's clear that they're going to do,"
You can see there's a hole here and a hole here, if it was true. "
Well, now I'm going to get a little bit of blood.
That's here.
Normally now levers the needle.
I would give you my arm, and I'd see that there's no stop.
But I believe that in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and turn it into something of real, and I'm going to leave it into something, and I'll go from the stage.
We're going to see different times in the next days I hope that you don't see the hour. Thank you very much.
So in my life I met a lot of fish.
I've love two.
The first one, it was more than another passional story.
It was a beautiful fish, prior, prinose, consistent one of the most sold on the menu.
which fish!
But the better, it was from a louder of the most elevated standard of environmental sustainability.
And so, you hear it in a place with consciousness to sell it.
I was involved in a relationship with this beauty for several months.
One day, the head of the company called me and asked me to talk to me to talk to a dedicated environmental sustainability.
"Of course," I said. "
This was a company that tried to solve what came to to solve what happened to be an unimaginable problem for our chef.
How do we continue to have fish in our menu?
During the last 50 years we've been fish in the mari the same way we have the forest to the soil.
The destruction was tremendous.
90 percent of the big fish, the ones that like so much the tunas, the halibut, the room, the weapons, the fish got shada, the fish, the fish got shades.
There's almost nothing.
So, it's like it or not the water, the fish, the headed of the fish, it will become part of our future.
There's a lot of topics.
The heaven fish pollutes, for the less the greater part of them, and they're inefficient. Get the tuna.
A big problem is that there's a food rate of 15 to one.
That means that we want to 15 libones of wildlife fish to get a libbra.
It's not very sustainable.
And even the sor is not a great.
Here's this, finally, finally there was a company that tried to do the right.
I wanted to help them.
The day before the event, I've been calling the relationship of the company.
Let's call it Don.
"Don", "I said," to understand, you're famous to do that, you're famous to do this. "
"Exactly," he said, "We're so far from the coast that our shoots are being papers, not concentrated."
And then he added, "We're basically a world."
"The conversion rate? 2.5 to a" he said. "
"The best in the sector."
2.5 to one, great.
"2.5 to one thing? What do you eat fish?"
"sustainable Proteine, he said.
"Grande, I said. And I said. And I said, and I said. And I'm going to ask.
That night, I was in bed, I thought, but what the hell is a sustainable?
So the day latest first of the event, I've called Don's still called Don.
I said, "Don, do you make some sustainable example of?"
He said he didn't know it, and he would ask.
Well, I'm talking to a little bit of people of the company and nobody had to give me precise.
Until until I talked to the biologist.
We also call Don.
"Don," I said, "Do you do some example of sustainable protein?"
Well, he mentioned a few heaven at the bottom of fish and then said, "Believe the chicken."
I said, "Believe of pollo?"
He said, "Yes, you know, you know, shooting, varians, vans, varians, sized and they eat me."
I said, "What percentage of your eat is made of pollo?"
I thought, we say, two percent.
"Well, it's about 30 percent," he said. "
I said, "Don, what is sustainable to give the fish of the pollo to eat?"
There was a long pause on the telephone and then said, "there are too too many chickens in the world."
I've been sorry about this fish.
No, because I'm not because they're one of those virtuous people and traditional and traditional.
Well, to say the truth is.
No, actually, I'm sorry about this fish, because, I'm going to do this fish.
The second fish is a different story.
It's a romantic story that kind of story that most knows and more love.
I ate it for the first time in a restaurant in the south of Spain.
One of my friend journalist had been talking about this fish.
It was basically meet.
He came to the table, he had a brilliant white color, almost scintiming.
The chef had cot too.
It's basically twice as much as it was cot.
Incredibly, it was still delighters.
Who is capable of making a fish so good after they're doing it?
I don't, but this guy yes.
Let's call it Miguel.
It's actually called Miguel.
No, he didn't have the fish, and it's not a chef.
For the least, not in the sense that we're going to usually.
It's a biologist in Veta Palma that's a fish that's a fish in the War's photos in the Wadalquir's philet.
Until the 1980s, the trained of the 1980s was managed by the argentini.
And they had belonges on what they had essentially been a paludosa.
And they had drenated the land building a series of canals by trying to convey the water in the river.
Well, they couldn't work to make the thing work from the economic point of view.
And, from the point of view, it was a disaster.
He had killed something like 90 percent of birds and, looking at the place, it's a lot of birds.
So, in 1982, an except company with an environmental consciousness.
What do they do?
They're going to start the stream.
literally, invertiring the switch.
Instead of trying to meet the water away from the ground they used channels to to put it.
They're all the channels.
They made a training training fires of 27 mile spigle, legs and legs and in this process, Miguel and in this process, Miguel and this company and invertirate and this company and invertiring the ecological destruction.
The training is incredible.
I mean, it's never seen one thing like this.
Look at the horizon that it seems to be away from a million miles and everything that you see is the inonade, and this rich, dense.
I've been there a little time ago with Miguel.
It's an incredible type three quarters Darwin and a fourth Crocodile Dundee.
Okay? We're doing it in the middle of this lagon and I was anyymous, I had the snenees and Miguel, calculated his lesson of biology.
I'm looking at a weight black.
And then he explains the mineral necessity of the planplanplankton, and then see a kind of fish of fish that reminds him of Tanzania.
It turns out Miguel has spent a lot of his career at the National Park Mikumi in Africa.
And I asked him how it had become a fish expert.
He said, "Pesci? I know nothing fish.
I'm an expert in relationships. "
And then it's still in the speech, and it's weird plants.
Don't get me wrong, all this was very fascinating, which is, a thing like the biotics community of natural state.
It's interesting, but I was in love.
And my head kept to rethink of that delish fish that I'd eat the night.
So the interrupp and said, "Miguel, what makes you fish so good?"
He pointed the algae.
"I know, the algae, the fitplankton, the relationships, yes, the relationships, yes, it's incredible.
But your fish fish fish are eating?
What's your food conversion of conversion?
Well, they responds to me telling me about how their own is a system so rich that the fish would eat exactly what they're sending in a wild environment.
The plants, the biomass, the zooplankton, is all what fish fish is.
The system is so healthcare that is completely self-renova.
There's no eat me.
You've ever heard about a training training that we don't eating his animals?
And then later, I was driving around the ground with Miguel and I said, "In a place like this soil that looks so natural as it looks like this natural as you do?"
And at that moment, it was like if the regist of a film had ordinary change the change of set.
We got the angle and see a scene between the most incredible thousands of rose thousands of rose and thousands of red fenicotteres a real rose that was lost to eye.
"That's the success, he said.
"Look at their pance, they're red.
They're banning. "
Banching? I was completely confused.
I said, "Miguel, but are they're not banchetting with your fish?"
"Yes," he said. "
"Perlet's about 20 percent of the fish and the eggs of the birds.
Last year on this properties there were 600,000 birds.
Today it's become the largest and one of the most important private healthcare for birds in Europe. "
I said, "Miguel, but a population of bird is not the last thing you want in a fish trailer is not the last thing you want in a fish training?"
He knows her head, no.
He said, "We're going to extend to be extinct.
This is a ecological network.
The fends eat eat the legs.
The legs eatplankton.
So, so much more it is red the trust of the fenicots better is the system. "
Okay, then then we get this: A allist that doesn't give to the eat his animals and measurement in the basic health of its predators.
A training fish, but also a healthcare for birds.
Ah, by the way, those faces weren't even have to be there.
They're in a town 150 miles where the conditions are better for the construction of nest.
Every morning, they fly fly for 150 miles, and they get to 150 miles per night, they make 150 miles for the back.
They're doing it because they're capable of following the A92.
On the night.
I was going to imagine a penguins so I looked at Miguel.
And I said, "Miguel, they fly fly for 150 miles to a night to turn to 150 miles to go back?
They do it for their little? "
And I looked at myself as if I had just mentioned a song of Whitney Houston.
He said, "No, they do it because food is better."
I didn't talk about the skin of my fish that was delizious, and I usually don't like the skin of the fish.
I don't like abbrustolita, I don't like crash.
It's that soap, as a belonging.
Don't almost ever cook.
And yet, when I hilled it in that south of the south of the Spain was not knowing for any fish.
He had a sweet soap and clean was like to give a dead sor to the ocean.
I said this in Miguel, and he announced.
He said, "The skin is as a waste.
It's the last defense before anything in the bodies in the fish.
It's been evolved to deal. "
And then she said, "But our water doesn't have unit."
Okay. A alevation that doesn't feeding his fish.
It's a very successful thing about his predators.
And then I realize that when he says that the alongst says that the alongst that's not a lot of mine because the water that flows in that farming is all the things that the river is all the things that the rivers tend with self is all the things that the rivers tend to bring chemistry today.
And when it goes down the system and it goes more clear than when it came.
The system is so healthcare, which purifices the water.
So, not just a training match that not only has to feeding his animals not just a training that measure its predators, but a very, which is literally a purification of water and not only for those fish but also for me and for you.
Because when the water comes out, if you go to the Atlantic.
It's a drop in the ocean, I know, but I'm going to be the blessing, and so you would do even because this story as romantics is also instructive.
You might say that it's a recipe for the future of good food is that we're talking about fish.
What we have now is a radically new conception of agriculture in which the food really really really good.
But for a lot of people, this is a bit too radical.
We're not realists, we're passionate about food.
We're love.
Let's addressing little farmers.
Let's addressing families.
Let's talk about local territory food.
Let's look at the biological.
And when you say that these are going to make sure the future of good food, some of them, and they say, "Hey you, you know, even to me, and they say," Hey, even as the robs that's going to feed the whole world?
How do you think we can feed the world? "
Can I be mayer?
It's a question I don't like.
No, because we're already producing even more than we can feed the world.
One billion people suffer the hunger today.
A billion -- more than a billion -- more than we've ever been -- because of huge inequality in the distribution.
You can see, I don't like this question because it has determined the logic of our food system in the last 50 years.
Dare cereals to the pesticide, chemicals that we have the fish and all of this time the fish and all this time the agricultures and all this time the agricultures, just asked, "What is we do?"
This was motivation.
It was the justification.
It was the American agriculture business plan.
We'd have to call it for what it is, a tremendous industry that's just quickly heroding the capital that makes the same production possible.
This is not an industry, and it's not agriculture.
Our panist today is threatened not because of providing providing the resource of declined, but for the resources in diminution, not for the last mechanics, but for fresh water, not for cooler, but for the fresh water, not for the sea, but for the forests and not to the fish and the fish, but for the fish and the fish.
Do you want to feed the world?
So let's start asking us, how are we going to feed ourselves?
Or, how can we create the condition that condition to feed up with every local community of feed itself?
To do that, we don't look at the agricultural model of the future.
It's an old and tired model.
It's all about capital, chemistry and machinery, and he's never really product of the good eat.
Instead, we look at the ecological model.
It's what's about two billion years of work.
Let's look at Miguel, to alevents like Miguel to farm and farm that are not claim in the facories themselves to reconstruct instead of consuming to the farms that grow extinctly rather than just by consuming the extensive, but experiment in relationships, because they're the experts, because they're those who are also in the experts.
If I have to be really better than they're chef than I've ever be.
You know, it's okay, because if that's going to be good food.
Thank you.
I grew up with a diet founding diet.
And then I've got to have a school now, an hour back and back every day.
And I was always immersed in a book, a science science science fiction, which was bringing my mind in other worlds, and satisfying, in the narrative, the insafety of curiosity that I had.
And that curiosity was also manifest in the fact that every time I wasn't in school, I was out in the boxes, and I was snakes, snakes, snakes, snakes, and I would take them home to the microscope.
I was a real geek of science.
But it was always trying to figure out the world, understand the limits of possible.
And my love for the science fiction was actually looking at the world around me, because what was going on in the world around me, because what was happening, in the lady of the oceans, Jacquacques Cousteau, and we exploring the oceans, Jacques Cousteau enter our room room with his fantastic documentary world that we would never even imagine.
So, it seemed to reinforce my passion for science fiction.
And I was an artist.
I knew draw. I knew I had paint.
And because there were no video games, and this display, nor all of these images in the sandwim of the media, I had to create these images in my head.
As children, as we used to read a book, we all had to, through the description of the author, put something on the screen of our heads.
And so, my answer was painting, draw creatures alien creatures, aliens, robots, spacecraft, all this stuff.
The lectures of mathematics were always beeting behind the text book.
That's because creativity had to find a way out.
And it was an interesting thing: the Jacques Cousteau programs me involved in a lot for the fact that there was a world right here.
Maybe I'd never gone to a world in a world.
It was very unlikely.
But that was a world where I could go really, right here on the ground, the richer and the exotic of what I could ever ever imagine these books.
So, I decided that I'd be a submotion at the age of 15.
And the only problem was that I lived in a small country in Canada, at 600 miles from the near ocean.
But I didn't leave me.
And I had my father until he found a school until he found a school in Buffalo, New York, just spent the border where we lived.
And I've been able to take the certificate in a YMCA's filled with the winter in Buffalo, New York.
And I couldn't see the ocean, the real ocean, for other two years, until I moved to California.
From then, in the last 40 years, I spent about 3,000 hours that I have been spent about 3,000 hours that are going on on.
And I learned that the depth of the oceans, even the unprofoundly, are rich of life that really goes beyond our imagination.
The imagination of nature is not borborborders of our human imagination.
Again today, I'm intiming from what I see when I make the immers.
And my story of love with the ocean continues, the stronger of how much it's never been.
But when I chosen a career, adult, I've chosen to do movie.
It looks like to be the best way to concile this smania to tell stories with the smania to create images.
And as a kid, I was constantly comics and so forth.
So, film was the only way to put together images and stories.
It was going back.
And of course, the stories that I've chosen to tell were stories of science fiction: "Earth," "Abyss."
And with "The Abyss," I join my love for the depth and immersions with the making of a film.
So, I've got the two passions.
From "The Abyss came out of something interesting that was to solve a specific problem that was to solve a specifically problem in that movie, which is to create that sort of liquid water creature -- we adopt the generated animation with the computer.
And so it was born the first character to the surface and soup to the computer that had ever seen in a film.
And even though the movie made a lot of money, I'd say that, I've been tremendous of something extraordinary, all the audience was hypnotized by this magic device.
You know, it's the Arthur Clarke for which every technology has sufficible is indistinguished by the magic.
They were seeing something magic.
And that's excited me.
And I thought, "Fantastic, this is a thing that has to be adopted in the movie art art art."
So, with "Terminator 2, my next film, we're going to go very well.
And we work with the Industrial Light and Magic, we created the guy's called the liquid metal. The success depended on how it would work.
And it worked. And we've created a magic.
And we got the same results with a public.
But we made a little bit more with that film.
So, by taking a line between these two points of experience, I came to the conclusion that this would have been a new world of all new world, it was a whole new world of creativity for artists.
So, I put a company in Stan Winston a societwith Stan Winston, my friend Stan Winston, who was the main trick and designer for creatures at that time, and we called Digal Domain.
And the principle of society was leaving the past, the analogical processes and so forth, and go directly to the digital production.
And so we did and gave us a competitive advantage for a while.
But we've been back to half the '90s in the part of creatures and characters, which is what we had to founded the society.
So, I wrote this text called "Avatar" with "" "with the intention of computers, and all the main world's generated with computers, and all the main stage that's generated at the computer and the whole world.
And that's all been remaded to the mittent.
The society kids have told me we weren't been able to do it for a little bit.
And so, I switch it, and I made this film of a big ship.
I thrown it there as a "Romeo and Juliet on a ship."
It would be a story of epic love, a passional film.
And I looked at, what I wanted to do was immergerms to see the relity of Titanic. "
That's why I did that film.
And it's the truth. I did not know.
But I've said, "We're going to immerse the relity.
We're going to use it for the beginning of the film.
It's going to be very important. It's going to be a great marketing. "
And I've convinced them to funding.
It looks like crazy. But this reports back to the imagination that creates reality.
Because we really created a reality and six months later, I found on a submersible Russible to two and a half miles of depth in the North Atlantic, to watch the real Titanic, not in a film, not in a film, not in a film, not in a film, not in a movie, not in a film, not in the movie, but to really.
I've been stunning.
And it took a lot of the preparation, we had to build movie and lights and lots of other things.
But I've been switched by the deep, it was like a space.
Where all of it was highly technical, and they would require huge planning.
You put you in this capsule, go down in this dark environment where you don't hope to be saved, you can't go back to.
And I thought, "Fantastic. It's like living in a science science fiction.
It's really great. "
And so, I've been affected by the depth of the ocean exploration.
Of course, the scientific component.
It was all. It was all.
It was curiosity. It was imagination.
And it was an experience that Hollywood could not offer me.
Of course, I could imagine a creature effect and create a visual effect. But I couldn't imagine what I saw out of the hbling.
In our next next, I've seen creatures with hydrothermal and, sometimes, things I'd never seen before, things that no one had ever seen before, that actually were not even given from science to the time to the science to the time at the time that we've seen.
So I was all taken from this, and I had to do more.
So I took a curious decision.
After the success of "Titanic, I said," OK, I'm going to go from my daily job regist of Hollywood, and I do the explorer for a while. "
So, we started to planning these expeditions.
We found ourselves to go to the Bismark and explore it with robots.
We've come back to the Titanic.
We took little robots that we had created with the optics of the optics.
And the idea was to go inside and make a nickles inside of the ship, which was never done.
No one had ever looked at the recruit. They didn't have the tools to do it, so we've created technology to do it.
So here I am on the Titanic, sitting in a submersible, looking at the asses that seemed like this, where I knew they looked like like this, where I knew that they were playing violinists.
And I'm driving a little robots through the corridor of the board.
When I tell it, I'm driving it, but my mind is in the vehicle.
It seemed to be physically in the relity of the Titanic.
And it was the most surgery experience that I've ever lived in, because before I was already going to get the corner, I knew what would have been behind, first that the lights of the vehicle it, because I'd been on the film.
And the set was based on a replica of the ship of the ship of the ship of the ship of the ship.
So it was an absolutely extraordinary experience.
And it really really made me to realize that in the experience of the telepresence that you can experience through these avatar robots, the mind is injected in the vehicle, in this other form of existence.
It was really very profound.
And it might be a small assage of what might happen between some decade when we start to have cycle of the edge of the explores or the other reasons in some kind of the future post-human loving.
So, we did these expeditions, and they really started to appreciate what was there under, as the depth of the ocean where these were in the ocean where these were in stayaries.
And basically, they're aliens right here on Earth.
They live in a chemosynthesis.
They don't survive in a system based on the sun as we do.
So, you can see animals that live close to 500 degree of the water at 500 degrees.
It seems even impossible that exists.
At the same time, I was interested in the space, again, again, it's the influence of science fiction, as a kid.
And I ended up in the space environment, really involved with the NASA, seducing in the consultant of NASA, in the commodity of the NASA, to go to the international biomed-cosmonauty, and all of these things, until fly fly to the international station with our 3D cameras.
It was fascinating.
But what I've finished to do was to bring spaces in us.
And they could bring them down because they could have access -- astrobiologists, people who were interested in these extreme environments, people who were interested in these extreme environments, taking samples and so on.
So we were documentary documentes, but we actually did science, space.
I had closed the ring between being fan of science fiction, as a kid, to do those things really.
And you know, during this path of discovery, I learned a lot.
I learned a lot of science. But I've learned a lot about leadership.
Everybody thinks that a regist should be a leader, the capital of the ship, or something like that.
And I didn't know about leadership before you do all those expeditions.
Why at some point I had to say, "What am I doing here?
Why am I doing this? What do I get? "
You don't make all of these show.
We're going to go to pari. There's not famous.
People think of nearly I went to "Titanic" and "Avatar" and "Having" and "I'm going to be a little bit.
I've been doing all these films for a limited audience so limited.
No famous, no glory, no money. What am I doing?
I'm doing it for the task in itself, and the ocean is the largest challenge is the largest challenge that exists, for the briefing of the discovery, and for that strange connecting when a small group of people form a very compact team.
Because we did all 10-12 people, working together for years.
Sometimes in the sea for 2-year-old.
And in that legacy, you realize that the important is that it's the important is that you have for them, when you've finished a task that you can't explain to anybody.
When you go back to the ground and explain, "We had to do this, and the fiber, and the attention, and this and all the technology, and that, all the technology, and the attention of the human perfoot, when you're working in the sea -- you can't explain. It's what maybe they just have the policy or the soldiers or lived in the soldiers,
Create a legacy of respect.
When I came back to make my next movie, which is "I tried to try to apply the same principle of leadership the same principle of leadership, and they can make their own.
It's really changed the dynamics.
And so here I've got a little group, in the inches, in the uncharted land with new new new technologies that didn't exist with new technologies that didn't exist before.
Thirrely exciting.
It's a very commitment.
And we got a family, in the four and a half years.
And it completely changed my way to do movie.
People's commented that I took the organisms from the ocean and I put them on the planet Pandora.
For me, it was the essence of the way to do business, the process, it was changed.
What can we then then then?
What are the lessons we learned?
I think the first is curiosity.
It's the most powerful thing that's.
The imagination is a force that can actually manifest.
And the respect of the group is more important than all the around the world.
Giggers are records come from me and say, "Dama few advice to do this."
And I say, "Don't get limit.
Other people will do it for you, not to make it alone, you don't make it out of you.
And you're going to run. "
And in NASA is always saying, "the mistake's wrong."
But the mistake has to be an option in the art and exploration, because it's like a room in the empty.
And there's an important attempt that has been done without risks.
You have to be willing to run these risks.
That's the thought I want to leave you, which is that in whatever you do, the mistake is an option, but I'm not. Thank you.
If I wanted to give you a big idea of it would be that the together of the data that we use is larger than the sum of its parts, and that, instead of thinking about the much information, I'd like to think about how to use information to make new relationships so that we can see new trend, otherwise invisible.
So here you can see the typical mortality statistics.
This tool that I use is a little experiment.
It's called Pivot, and with Pivot, I can choose to filter one cause of death, say, accidents.
And then we can see new relationships.
The reason is that here in the central part of the people are more fragile and here are more fragile.
We can take a step back and reorganize data for death, we can see that circulators and cancer are the greatest Indian, but not for everybody.
If we're going forward and we filter for age, let's see that the accidents are the cause of death I worry more.
It's closer, it's most of men.
So you'll have understood that visualize information and data in these way is a little bit like swim in a sea of information of graphy.
What if we can do that with data because we can't do it with content?
For example, we have the cover of every Sports Illustrated.
It's all over here.
You can get into your rooms, and you can try.
With Pivot you can see a decade.
Or a specific year.
You can isolate a number in particular.
For example, let's take the athletes like this number, their sports.
I'm a fan of Lance Armstrong, so click here and I see all the numbers where the numbers that they're going to put in Lance Armstrong.
Now, if I want to give us a look at this, I could think, why don't give a look at all the cycle? "
So I take a step back and alargo back and the visual.
And now I see Greg Lemond.
And you'll have understood that when you navigate in this information, and it's not just a research, it's not just a research, it's not just a research, it's not just a brewser.
But you do something slightly different.
It's a half that we're going to change how we can use information.
Let's still this idea that may seem a little bit crazy.
And we took every single page of Wikipedia and we reduced it to a short sums that's in a little synossis and an icongside that is the tematics.
I'll just show you the first 500 between the most visits of Wikipedia.
Even in this screen, we can do a lot.
You know, what areas of the tematic areas are visiting about Wikipedia.
And this point at this point point that governmentally.
We're seeing that option we see that the chories of Wikipedia, more often associated with this voice are the "Personages of Time Magazine.
That's meaningful because it turns out something that in Wikipedia, there was no.
And you can only see that you can just take a step back to see the together.
If I take one of these sums I can then zooming on category, "I'll go to" Time Magazine.
and see them.
So, I'll see that most of governmentally from some of the world of science. A minor number of business in the business of business.
Here's my boss.
One is from music.
And, rather interesting, Bono has also won a TED.
So we're going to see all the winners of TED.
For the first time, we're actually going to be able, as if it was a network, not by page, but at a level of high abstraction.
I want to show you another thing that might surprise you.
This is the New York Times.
More, this application -- we don't call browser, because it's not a browser, but it's still a browser, but it's a technology for zoom in the web, like this.
I can take a step back and go back to a specific section. This is important, because just seeing the Web pages so that's just seeing the web, so it's just seeing the web.
I can zooming on what I did in specific moments.
In fact, you can see the state of the demo that I just presented.
I can have a way to resee other things I've seen in the day.
If I want to take a step back and see all I can do at the pet of my historian or the historian of my research or the historian.
Here I was trying to snow, I was looking at the Bing motor, here for Live Labs Pivot.
And I can zoom in on my web, and just just just releasing from here.
A reused a lot of times, and in every case, and in every case, the outcome is larger than the sum of the parts, of the data.
In the world, the data is seen as a kind of malbuilding.
It's about information.
It's about the data.
What if we put down down on the top if we put the web on the other side, we would take it from a lot of things to another, we could actually go from a lot of things, then we could see those structures that would otherwise the structures that otherwise would otherwiring the structures that they would be born?
And then instead of feeling we could really extract information.
Instead of us to do with information, we can rarely take out of knowledge.
And from the knowledge, maybe you can even the wisdom.
And with that thank you.
All of these days are all talking about happiness.
I asked to count the number of books the content of books the word "happiness and published in the last five years, they stopped count after they've achieved to 40, and there were a lot more.
There's a huge wave of interest on happiness, some researchers.
There's a lot of coaching happiness.
Everybody would want to make more happy people.
But despite all this flow of work, there are a series of "trap in cognitive trap, which somehow impossible can make ideas to elaborate about happiness.
My talk is going to be more importantly, these cognitive traps.
And it's about profitable people think about their happiness, and it's about the study that we're confused as everybody else.
The first of these traps is the retlater to admit the complexity.
In fact, that the word happiness is no longer a word useful, as much as much as much as the applies that is to too much as much as much as much as much as the applies.
I think that's going to restrict meaning, but in massive line, we're going to have to tell us about this acceptions and we're going to have to go to to adopt the most complicated vision of what "well-being."
The second trap is the confusion between experience and memory: it's basically to choose between being happy in life and be happy about their lives and be happy about their lives.
And these are two extremely different concept, both part of the concept of happiness.
And the third one is the illusion of the focus of that is unfortunate that we can't think of any circumstances that are unundistort the importance.
I mean, it's a real cognitive trap.
and there's no way to do the right thing.
I'd like to start with an example of a person who, after a session, and answers, after a lesson, telling a story.
[Disse] Disse while listening to an absolutely magnificent music.
And then he added, very emotional way, which had been switched out the whole experience.
But that was not true.
What it was the memory of the experience.
He had lived the experience.
And he was listened for 20 minutes of the wonderful music.
but it wasn't contained to anything because he was reminded with a certain memory; The Rememember was ross, and the memory of what was left.
So what this is says to us in the bottom, is that we could think of ourselves and other people in terms of two. "It's a bit."
There's a site that lives in the present, which lives in the present, and it's capable of relive the past, but that actually only has the present.
It's the self self that lives lives in the experiences, "and what the doctor is coming -- you know when the doctor asking," Ti's bad now, when the doctor asking, "Ti does all the time here?"
And then there's the self self is that you remember, "it's the" self that's signs, and it's that signs, and it's that's the doctor is you're heard in the last time? "
or something like that.
That's two different, the self that lives a experience and what if the memories, and they're going to live a few of confusion about the notion of happiness.
The self, it's a singer.
And this process begins with a fundamental response of our memories -- begins immediately.
We don't tell stories when we decide to tell them.
Our memory tells us stories, which is, what's left us with our experiences is a story.
Let me start with an example.
It's an old study.
That reports the experiences of two patients in a painful process.
I'm not going to do in details. It's not even painful to details today, but it was painful when this study was conducted in the '90s.
You asked the patients to bring their pain every 60 seconds.
And here is the results for two patients.
Those are the results.
If you ask, "Who's two suffered of the more?"
It's a very simple question.
Curingly, the Patient B has suffered of more.
his colony coloned more and for every minute of pain of pain, A patient's suffered from the patient's patient's suffering at least how much.
But now there's another question, "How about these patients think they're suffering?"
And here's the surprise: Oxious Patient had a memories of the most worst Patient B.
The colonful stories were different because one of the specifically delicate part of the procedure is the way -- no one of those stories is particularly -- but one of the two is particularly a different --
And the worst is that where the pain was mainly in the final moment.
It's a negative story.
How do I know it?
Because we asked these people after the colonscopy, and also at time distance, "How much negative was the experience, all considered?"
and it turns out that it's worse for B, in the memories.
So it's a direct conflict between the site that lives lives and the site that reminds them.
On the site of the site that lives lives, it's clear that B has suffered most.
So, what you could do for the patient A, and we've done clinical experiments, and it was actually done, and it works, you could extend the tube without getting getting getting out too much.
This is going to cause a pain of pain in in the patient, but only a little bit, and less than before.
And by doing this for a couple minutes, the sis that live the experience of the Patient's experience. It's going to be worse, and the site that reminds the experience of the Patient A is better memory of the experience.
How do you call a story?
And that's true of the stories that are from the reminds that for the stories that we invent. What's defines a story, are the significant and the final moments.
The final is very, very important and, in this case, the final dominated.
So, the site that lives lives in a lot of life in a way.
It's been experiences that they're going to ask you, "What happens to these moments?
And the answer is simple.
They're always trying to say that most of our life -- as I've calculated -- I've calculated -- I've been doing this about 600 million of them. In a month, if they're counting about 600 million. In a month, if they're counter.
Most of them are completely ignored by the site.
And yet, in some way you have the feeling that they should count, that what happens in these moments of experience is our life.
These are the limited resources that we're spending as we're in this world.
And as a spends it, it would seem relevant, but it's not the story that the site that reminds for us.
And so we have a site that reminds and a sis that live experiences that are quite different.
The largest difference between the two is how much of treat time.
From the site's point of view that lives, if you're in vacation, and the second weeks is funny as the first, then the vacation of two weeks is twice better than a week.
But that's not the way that the site works.
For the site that reminds, a two weeks is actually better than a weeks of vacation, because there's no new memories because there are no new memories in addition.
You didn't change the story.
And in this way, time is the variable of critical variable that's reminds from the site that lives lives lives.
The time has a limited impact on this story.
Well, the sone that reminds the experiences makes more than remember and tell stories.
It's actually the self self that make decisions because, if we consider a patient who's had, for example, two different medical colonscopes with two different doctors and deciding that one of the two to choose, what the memory is going to be chosen.
The sets that live experiences doesn't have voice in those choices.
In fact, we don't choose between experiences, but between the memories of those experiences.
And even when we think about our future, in gender we don't think about our future as experiences.
Let's think of our future as a memories.
You can basically consider this situation, like a sanny of the site that reminds, and you can think of the sis that you remember, and you can think of the site that you can remember as if you turn out to the site that live experiences, and it doesn't need.
I have the feeling that when we're going on in vacation, you often, the case that's vacation in good part of our site that reminds.
And that's a little bit difficult to justify.
That's how much's consuming our memories?
This is one of the explanations that comes to the predominance of the site that reminds.
When I think of that, I'm in my mind is in the Antarctica of a few years ago, which is one of the best of my life, and where I think relatively often, compared to other vacations.
And I've probably spent thinking of that journey of three weeks, to say, 25 minutes in the last four years.
If I'd ever opened up the 600 photographs of the journey, I'd spent another another now. It's three weeks of journey that translates into male. It's a discussion.
Well, I could be a little bit extreme, in my waste for the consumption of member, but even if you do more than this, a question of the consumption, but even if you do more than this, a question is pone.
Why are we weight to the memory of the weight that we make experiences?
I want you to think of an experiment with thinking.
Imagine that in the next vacances that at the end of the vacation of the photographs will be destroyed, and you will take a medicine for the love of love with love with love to your love.
Would you get the same vacances? What if you could choose a different vacance, you create a conflict between the two site, and you have to think of how to solve that conflict and actually isn't so obvious because, if you think in terms of time in terms of time, then you're going to have an answer.
And if you think in terms of memories, you might get another answer.
Because we choose the vacations we do, it's a problem that's a problem that's putting us in the two.
And the two is two notions of two notions of happy.
There's actually two concepts of happy concepts that we can use, one for each site.
So you can ask: How much is happy the sis that it makes the experience?
And then you can ask: How happy are the moments in the life of the site that lives lives?
And it's about -- happiness for times, it's a complicated process.
What are the emotions that we can measure?
And yet, we're able to do a good idea of the site of the site that lives lives in time.
If you ask the site of the site that reminds, it's a completely different thing.
It's not how much of a person live.
It's about how much it's the person when you think about his life.
It's a very different idea.
Anyone is not able to distinguish these two notions, will not do anything else that's going to do something else that's to make confusion in studies, and I'm going to be, and they're going to be able to distinguish those two notion in this way.
The difference between the site of the site that lives lives in the experiences and satisfaction of the sm that memories has been recognized in the last years, and they're now in the effort to measure the two separately, the Gallup to a world where more than half a million people have been underposte to one on what they think about their lives and their experiences.
And there were other studies in this direction.
So in the last few years, we started to learn about the happiness of two.
And the largest lesson we learned, is that they are very different.
You could know how much one person is to be satisfied with their life, and yet this doesn't tell you about how much happy they're living their life and vice.
To give you an idea of correlation, the correlation is about 0.5.
What if I met someone, and they said, "oh, his father and's high," oh, "what would you know?
Well, you would know something about his height, but with a lot of uncertainty.
You'd always have a little bit of uncertainty.
If I tell you that someone thinks that his life is at the level eight in a scale of a 10, you will be very uncertain of how happy to be with their own shares.
So the correlation is low.
We have a certain knowledge of what searches controls the satisfaction of the satisfaction.
We know that money is very important, the goals are very important.
We know that being happy is to be satifacts with the people who like us, spend time with the people who like us, spend time with the people who like us.
There's a more pleasure, but these are the main ones.
So if you want to maximize the happiness of two, you will end up doing very different things.
And the conclusion of what I've said now is that we don't think of happiness.
This is completely different.
In the more, very quickly, another reason that we can't think of linear to happiness is that we're not paying attention to the same things when we think about life, and when we live life.
So if you do the simple question of how happy people in California, you can't get the question of how happy people in California, you can't get the right response.
When you ask this question, you think you should be more happy in California, that in Ohio.
What happens is that when you think about life in California, you're thinking about the contest between California and other places, and for example, and for example is on the climate is on the climate.
Well, it turns out that climate is not the important for the self is that it's important for the site that lives lives and it's not very important for the seven is that reflected to the people.
But since the seven is that reflected is in charge, you might end -- some people might end, at the end, you could end, move in California.
And it's interesting verify what's going to happen to the people that are transfer in California in the hope of being more happy.
Well, the sone that lives lives will not become more happy.
We know it.
But one thing is going to happen. They're going to look happily, because when they think, they'll remember how terrible was time in Ohio.
And they're going to think I've made the right.
It's very difficult to think of well-being and I think I gave you the idea of how difficult it is.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have a question for you.
Thank you very much.
When we were at the telephone a couple of weeks ago, I mentioned me that a interesting result that's interesting that's where the Gallup.
Is it something that thinks we've got a few minute?
Daniel Kaheman: Yeah.
I think the result of the interesting pieces we found in the Gallup, and it's a number, which we weren't expect to find.
We found that, with reference to the sm of the site that lives lives.
When we've observed as feelings varied with the income, we found that, under the income of 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans, on a very large sample of about 600,000 Americans a study in a very large sample of about 600,000 dollars a year --
CA: 60,000 DK: 60,000 dollars a year, people are infelected, and they become progressively more infelous than that, you can find a poor, Al above that, we find a piper line.
I mean, I've seen the lines.
Yeah, what's happening is that the money doesn't have happiness of the experience, but the lack of money for sure, and we can measure that very, very, very clearly.
In terms of the other is, the site that reminds, is all another story.
The more money you earn, the more content six.
This talk is not about emotion.
CA: But Danny, everybody's effort of Americans are about life, freedom, the search of happiness.
If people took this seriously discovery, basically, which is what we believed, for instance, politics on the pocket and so on.
There's a chance that politicians, and the nation in general, can take a discovery like that seriously and bring a public policy based on it?
DK: You know I think you recognize the role of happiness in public politics.
The present of consideration will be slows in the United States, there's no doubt, but in the U.K., it's become reality, and in others.
People are starting to recognize that they should think about happiness when they think about public politics.
It's going to get a little bit and people will start to talk about if they want to study the experience of happiness or if they want to study the value of life that we need to start this debate to the most soon.
How to grow the happy directions, it takes different directions to how you think, and depending on how you think, and depending on the site that it's reminds or to the site that makes the experiences.
All of this influence will affect, I think, in the years that will come.
In the United States, they're doing effort to measure the experience of happiness.
And this, I think, will go into the next decade, maybe two, maybe two, of the national statistics.
CA: Well, it seems to me that this is going to be, or for the less should be, the discussion of the more interesting politics to follow in the next few years.
Thank you very much for making invented the behavioral economics.
Thank you Danny Kaheman.
Today I'm going to talk about energy and climate.
It can look strange, since I've seen that in my work to the foundation of vaccines and seeds, things to invent and give the world to help the two billion poorest people to live lives better.
But climate and energy, actually, actually, they're extremely important for this people, moves, they're more important to them to the world.
A worst climate means, for many years, loss of collection.
It's going to be too much rain, or too little.
The things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support.
which brings to hunger. The conflict.
Climbs, they're going to be for them terrible.
Even the cost of energy is, for them, important.
In fact, if you could put the price of one thing, to reduce poverty, you would choose of a big big long the energy.
The price of the energy price goes down in time.
And it's a civilization of energy progress in the energy fields.
The coal revolution has food that industrial.
And even in the 20th century, we've been watching a quickly decline in the price of the electricity, which explains why we have refrigered, and doing so many things.
In the rich world, so we're as much as the electricity in a excellent situation.
But as the price scenes, for example of the half, we need to respect a new wind, the constitution of CO2 emissions.
CO2 is climing the planet, and its equation is very simple.
The CO2 emitted as a temperature of temperature, which induces very negative.
It's about climate and, maybe even worse, even worse, indeed, in the sense that the natural ecosystems can't look at these quickly changes and so they collapse.
The value of how much classroom temperature because of a given increase in CO2, and as each of the two worst things that's worse, but not.
And there's certainly uncertainty about how negative will be such bad effects, but they're going to be negative.
I've often asked the best scientists: Do we have to make emissions of zero?
We can't only reduce them half or a fourth?
And the answer is that, until we don't go down to zero, the temperature will continue to go.
It's a big challenge, so.
It's not like to say, "Let's go to a 3.5 feet under a bridge."
It's not going to put it a little bit. "
It's got to go down to zero.
Now, we're going to make a lot of CO2 every year, over 26 billion tons.
About 20 tons for every American.
For the poor countries, it's less of a tons in the poor.
The world's media is about five tons per capita.
And somehow, we need to do progress that zero-way, we need to make progress.
The emissions are constantly increased.
Only some economic changes have changed this tendency, so so we have to go from increasingly diminually, to zero-minually.
This equation has four factors.
It's a series of multiplications.
We have a lot of the left, the CO2, which has been building, and the factors on the right are the population, the services that in the media is the population, the average of each person use, the services and the CO2 eman of energy.
Let's look at each factor and see how we can get it.
Probably, one of these numbers have to go down to almost zero.
It's high school.
Let's see a little bit.
The first factor is the population.
The world has today 6.8 billion people.
We go to the nine billion.
If we make a good job with new vaccines, health, healthcare, we can deproductive health, we can declaring the maybe 10, 15 percent, but here's 10, 15 percent, but here we record an increase of about 30 percent.
The second factor are the services we use.
Which understanding all, the food we eat, the dress, TV, the TV, the heat.
They're willing, and liberate to rise of poverty, it's going to have some services for almost all the world.
And it's a positive thing that's.
In the rich world, in the richest billion, we could probably save and use less, but in media, every year, this number will go.
And so, complex services, the amount of services that you're going to be more than twice.
This is a very simple example of service.
You know, you have the illumination in your house, to do the tasks, but these guys don't, so they except and read their compelling under the light buls.
The efficiency -- and, the energy for unit's energy for unit -- here finally, there's good news.
This factor is not increasing.
Thank you very much, and new ways of illuminate, automobiles made differently, construction made differently, for many services, in many of the services that can be the consumed energy consumed.
In some services, you can reduce 90 percent.
There's some other services, like fertilizers, or the airplane, where the margin of improving are very, very, very inferior.
So, complex energy consumption is going to be reduced by three to maybe six times.
But these first three factors are reducing emissions from 26 to the best cases, maybe 13 billion tons.
It's not enough.
Let's look at the fourth factor, the key amount of CO2 emit for units of energy.
The question is, can we reduce the zero?
If you burn coal, no.
If you burn natural gas, no.
Almost all the ways of making of electricity today, part of renewables and nuclear, CO2.
What we're going to have to do on a global scale.
And we need energy need energy miracles.
Col term, "miracle," I don't mean something impossible.
The microprocessor is a miracle. The personal computer is a miracle.
The Internet, and his services, are a miracle.
People today here today have been a lot of miracles.
We don't normally have a scade, a date within which we have a data by releasing.
Usually, you're going to the window and something happens, something else is not.
In this case, we have to drive to all speed, and make a miracle in a very restricted times.
I asked myself, how to illustrate this concept?
Is there some natural example, a few of demonstration that capture capture the imagination of people?
I rethought about a year ago, when I brought to mosquito, and people found it funny.
And the part of the fact that, in the world, there's people who live with mosquitos.
This is my idea for energy.
And I decided that I wanted to the lilights would have been this year my contribution to the environment.
Here's the lights here.
They tell me that they don't get out of the board.
... now, we can invest tricks like this, but they won't be help.
We need solutions, a lot or a lot of them are, which will work on big scale and very reliable, and even though they're exploring in many directions, I think that only five few important effects.
I have expect the mareas, the geotermal, nuclear fusion, biofusion.
They could also give some contribution, and if they can make more than I think, as much better, but here I'll be interested in that we're going to be able to work on each of these five, and not give up any of those five, and not give up to any of those five, and not give up a lot of difficult challenges.
Let's look at the first fossil fuels, coal or natural or natural gas.
Here's our task looks simple, but it's not, and it's captured the CO2, after the combuston, at the end, at the time, at the combusting, and hoping that we're going to be there.
Today, there are experimental technologies that captured 60 -- 80 percent of CO2, but they're going to be very complicated and it will be hard to even get to agree on where this CO2.
The spinous issue is still the long time.
Who will trust you?
Who guarantee is that literally billions of times more volume than all sorts of imaginable, like nuclear or other nuclear.
It's a huge volume.
So it's a difficult problem.
Another source would be the nuclear would be the nuclear.
But the nuclear presents three big problems.
The cost, especially in the very regulate countries, it's high.
The question of security, the security feeling that nothing can go wrong, sick the employment of human workers, and that the immersible not used to be used to be a beautiful purpose.
And how then run the scories?
The amount of laughing, the concerns are many.
People need to be reassure.
So, you're very difficult problems, which you could solve, and what we should work.
The last three of the five sources, I bought them.
They're the people often definitely defining renewables.
And to say the great advantage of not to require a combustible, present some of them.
The first one is that the energy density of these technologies is decisely inferior to that one of an electric center.
It's about collecting energy, and so many squares, and so many squares, of thousands of times more estese than a normal electric central.
Also, these sources are intermittent.
The sun doesn't go all day, nor every day, and every day, and even the wind suffering.
So if you look at these sources, you need to find a way of eroging energy even when the source doesn't make it.
God challenges make us on the front of the cost.
And the distribution.
For example, let's say that this source source of energy is in the summer.
So you don't just need technology, but you're also going to have to do the connect with the risks of approves to the risk.
And finally, the accumulation problem.
To stimate the size of the problem, I've analyzed all kinds of bacterial faces, computers, telephones, from any, I've compared to the amount of electrical energy used in the world and I found that all the bacterial energy.
So we really need a big step forward, a improvement of 100 times as we approach to use.
Which is not impossible, but it's not very simple.
This problem is already manifest when the sources "intermittent," produce more than, 20 to 30 percent of the energy consumed.
And then then you go down to those sources for 100 percent, you need a battery's needed a miracle. "
But how are we going on on on this street? What is the right approach?
It's a Manhattan? What could it solve the problem?
A lot of companies, hundreds, they have to put them to work.
We need at least percent people in each of these five sectors.
Most of them, look at them, you would call them. The one that's a good.
And I think that here, in the TED group, a lot of people are already working in these fields.
Bill Gross has different companies, including a called eSolar that vant big technologies in the thermical solar technology.
Vinod Khosla is investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting pots, and I'm giving my support to this.
Nathan Myhrvold, and I'm going to be funding a company that, you're going to follow the nuclear.
There's some innovations in the range, the nuclear nuclear, the nuclear nuclear nuclear.
But from a long time, the sector is stopped, which there's a few good ideas around is not then that there's some good ideas around.
The idea of Earth is that, instead of burning only part of the uranium, the U235, the one percent of the uranium, the one percent of the uranium available, we decided to burn the U238, 99 percent. It's a crazy idea.
To the truth if it's a lot of time, but it's never been supported whether it would work or not, you can do a simulation and see that yes, with the right materials, it seems to work.
And because it's 99 percent of the uranium, the structure of the cost of the core miles are lastically.
You burn the scories, and they're using the scories, and they're using reactors of today, which became, from the problem that they were, a exploiting resources.
They consume the uranium while the uranio. It's a kind of candela.
It's like a strain of wood. It's called a wave. It's called the wave of progressive.
From the perspective of the problem is solved.
Here's a picture of a place in Kentucky.
That's the 99 percent uranium, which has been taken the part of the time they're used as well as well as well as well as well, and so it's called impoor.
These are going to be energy from the United States for centuries.
And by filming the sea water, with an economic process, there would be enough fuel for the rest of the life of this planet.
So, a lot of challenges tend to us, but this is an example of hundreds of ideas that we need to progress.
How should we measure our progress?
What should be the pain?
We can refer the goal, and then we're going to be able to intermeds.
You've heard a lot of people talking about an 80 percent reduction for 2050, it's really important to do.
20 percent will be produced by poor countries, and from a little bit of agriculture.
At that point, we're going to be solved the deforestation and the production of the cement and the production of cement.
To get 80 percent, so the developed countries like China, including countries like China, they're going to have to replace their electrical production.
The other question is, we're doing this technology to zero emissions?
We basically put it in the developed countries?
Do we're going to spread altitude?
It's a very important thing.
It's a key element key thing.
Now, when we're looking at the page of 2020?
That should have the same two aspects.
We'd have to implements to start to get reductions.
We're going to be the lower amount of CO2, and so the temperature.
But the vote in this material, doing things that don't make great reductions, it's just a weight paral, or even slightly inferior, at the other, which is the speed of the innovation of new invention.
We need to push these progress to all speed, and we can measure the speed from the number of companies, and we can measure the speed from the number of companies,
A lot of the books have been written about.
The book of Al Gore, "The choice," and David McKay, "" Suthout of Energy Without the Hot Air. "
These books will be able to create a context in which they create a context in which they need to do the debate because these things need to have to be a spread.
A lot of things have to have to come to contemporarily.
So I have a wish, I have a wish.
A very concrete that we're going to invent technology.
If I had to choose one wish for the next 50 years, to choose: to choose the president of the country, the achievement of a vaccine, which I'm doing a vaccine, or I would choose this last.
It would be the greater impact.
If this wish won't achieving, the fruit between who thinks and the long-term, between the United States and China, between the United States and China, between poor and rich, it will be terrible, and particularly, the life of those two billion people will be a much worse.
So what do we have to do?
So what I'm inviting you to take the initiative and get?
It's necessary a larger support for research.
When nations come together in places like Copenhagen, they wouldn't have to talk about CO2.
They should argue the program of innovations, and you'd be so little bit of investigating in these innovative approaches.
We need incentives, taxes on CO2, the "cap and transs" instruments, "instruments, the cost of pollution.
We need to spread the message.
We need to make this more rational dialogue, and it has to include the government choices.
It's a commitment, but I think it's made.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Only for you know more about Earth, here...
first of all, can you give us an idea of the size of the investments?
Bill Gates: Realizing the software, to hiring all the great scientists, what we've done, asking all the big scientists, which we're already going to have to talk about millions, and even when we're tested to the materials in a safe reactor, to be safe that work only hundreds of millions.
The difficult thing is to build the pilot, to build the reactor, finding several billion, the authority, the place where it will be built the first examples.
Once built the first, if it works as announced, it's going to be the egger of Colombo, because the cost of generated energy, are completely different from nuclear nuclear, and that we know today.
CA: So if I understand well, this implics of the construction, well underground, of a nuclear stable nuclear fuels, of this kind of uranium.
Then the process begins from the top and progress?
BG: Right. The reactors, today, they are restricted, many people, many controls that can't work, open, and continue, things that enter and except,
It's not good.
If instead of fuel is very cheap and you can make it for 60 years, put it in and you can make it for 60 years, you're in and forget all those complexity.
He's going to be burning to go to the sesser, and then it goes.
CA: A nuclear plant that's a nuclear.
BG: Yeah. Well, the waste can leave there, and then you can take them in another reactor and burn them.
And we're going to begin with existing, we're now conserved to cooling or containers or in the front of the reactors.
They'll be our first fuel.
So what it was a problem of conventional reactors will be the fuel of our, and the volume of reactors, and the reflew will reduce, not just this process.
CA: But when you're talking around the world of the potential of this technology, where most interest in its achieving?
BG: Well, there's no place in particular, and there's all these interesting rules of transparency on what's defined nuclear, so we're rescued very interest.
Our staff was in Russia, India, China.
I just met the Sgretary for Energy.
We've talked about how this idea is the current program.
I'm optimistic. Francese and Japanese did work in this field.
It's a variation on something that's already been done.
It's an essentially improvement, but it's a fast reactor, that many countries have already built a good reactor, which is already built a good reactor.
CA: What are the time and the probability that are and the probability that something like that?
BG: Well, for one of these projects at the scale, that produces energy, which produces not very much, we're talking about 20 years to design and 20 years to build it.
That's the exadline that the environmental models are demonstrates.
Thirrepower, if everything is well, that's not a little bit, it could easily ssue this goal.
And now they're fortunately, dozens of companies in the sector, that analogy, if their research works for their plants will be erator, they can compare.
And it's better if a lot of solutions will happen, because at that point you can remember a set of solutions.
It's necessary that at least a success.
CA: Parlying of important innovations, revolutionally revolutionier, this is the largest you know?
BG: A revolution is the most important thing.
It would be also without the environmental winners, but the environmental winners make it really much more important.
We're going to the nuclear we have other innovators.
We don't know their job like this, but one is the nuclear "modular," a nuclear approach.
There's a liquid reactor. It seems to be hard to do, but maybe they say the same thing of us.
So there are different, but the beautiful is that a lot of urany is that a sprigiones a million times more energy than a million times more energy of a molecule, say, carbon, so if you can run the negative aspects, the potential aspects, the potential of effectively on the environment, and other, it makes a classroom.
CA: And if it doesn't work?
Shouldn't we have to be able to start to try to keep the Earth temperature?
BG: If you're in that situation, it's a little bit like when you've eat too, and you're going to have a heart attack.
Where do you go to that point? You could have to find a surgeon or something like it.
There's a research line on the geoengineering called geoengineering, which are various techniques that slower down to make us earn 20 or 30 years in which they coordinate the action.
It's like cleaning a polar.
I hope you don't need it.
Some people say they don't even work on the police because you might be going to continue to eat, because the surgery will go.
I don't think it's a unting choice, view the importance of the problem, but now in the environment of the geoengineering asks to us if you're going to take to the solutions of them in the case that events, or innovations come later than previous innovations, later than the previous innovations in the previous of the problem, but now in the importance of the problem, but now in the time of the geoengineering.
CA: Sptical skeptical: if I had a sentence or two from dir to them, how could you persuade persuade that they've got back?
BG: Well, unfortunately, there are different kinds of skeptical and the ones that have advances are very few.
Some people say that there is a negative feedback to the clouds of warming.
They're very, very, very few things that can only say that there's one probability on a million that's going to have the main issue looks like the AIDS looks like.
You put a mistake now and pay for the consequences just a lot after it.
And so, when you're in a thousand emergency, the idea of making sacrifice you're just after --
It's not well known.
In fact, the IPP.C.'s not necessarily the worst case; there's people in the rich world that look at the IPPC and says: Of, it's not going to be.
The fact is that the uncertainty should pushing us.
But my dream is that, if we can do it economic, and to respect the winners on the CO2, then the skeptics on the CO2, then they're going to tell me if I don't emit, but I'll accepted because it's cheap because it's cheap because it's more cheap than before before you get this, but I'm going to do this, and to respect the win the front of CO2,
CA: Would you be this answer to Bjorn Lomborg, that if you invest all of the energy problem, that if you invinvall of your energy's problem, you want to get sacrifice, and what to make money, when there's best to do, when there are better things to do, it means to be a sepire resources?
BG: Well, the actual waiting for development --
We say that the U.S.A should spend 10 billion as more than how much they're now going to do now.
It shouldn't have to distrate resources.
The things that make a lot of money, and here are also reasonable to this dishear, they're financial solutions.
For me, it's more importantly, I think.
Unless you're not funding the curve of learning, getting closer to the point where they're going to be very cheap, I think that the effort will be very cheap.
If the alternative was, "we make the expensive energy, so that only only rich, so that only rich can afford, all the present to the five times so much without changing the lives of life.
The disaster would be for those two billion.
And also Lomborg has reviewed his positions.
His issue now is, "Why don't it's not discussing and Svilup?"
It's for his past again, you've got to the "skeptical, but he's just a little set, and so he's going to be switched, and so he's going to be able to be stand.
And it's a question that I think is appropriate.
It's incredible as a little bit of research and development.
CA: Well Bill, I think just about speaking about the most of the audience of the audience of the audience of saying that I hope to see your desire to become reality. Thank you.
BG: Thank you.
I'd like to share with you a discovery that I did a few months ago when I was writing an article for the Wired magazine.
I've always got my syxymield at my hands every time I write something, but I'd already run the article and I've never ever ever ever ever in my life tried the word "disability to see what I would find.
Let me read you the results.
"Disable", agricultural: damage, no, useless, useless, inhurt, papers, demand, papered, papers, heaven, decreased, heaven, impoverished, impoor, impoor, Senile, decrease, Senile, decrew, decreased out of the circulation, left out of the circulation,
Contrarians: In shape, strong.
And I was reading this list at a high voice to a friend and the beginning, it was so ridiculous, but, just I read the word die, and I had to stop me to get me to pick me up to the shock and the impact that the above the shock of these words left.
You know, we're talking about, of course, an old Middle sympymous.
I'm thinking, it's going to be an old building, right.
But, in fact, the ediition was the first 80 years.
When I was starting my elementary schools and I was forming and learning what was out of my family and things in the world around me.
and, I used to tell them, thank God, I wasn't using the dictionary of the syonymous to that time.
I mean, from this explanation looks like that I've been born in a world that seeing someone like me as one that has nothing to positive in no way for them, when, in fact today, they're celebrated for the opportunity and the venture that my life has procured.
So I'm immediately going to see on the building in 2009 in the network, waiting me to find a review without value.
This is the version of description.
Unfortunately, it's not much better.
I find the last two words underneath "particularly uncontrary" particularly the whole, "the whole" and "healthcare" and "healthy." "" and "healthy."
that's what we think about people when we see them with these words.
It's about the values behind these words, and how we build these values.
Our language influence our thinking and our vision of the world and how we see other people.
In fact, many civilization, including that Greek and Romana, believed that Greek and that Romana, they had to say that was more powerful, because to say the things were going to be higher voice to existence.
So what reality is we want to bring, a person who's limited, or a person with more force?
So, we just just just going to see something just like nominate a person, a child, we could put tapes and throwing out of their strength.
Wouldn't we want to open doors for them?
One person, so that opened me the doors, it was the doctor of that I was kid Alley Dupont in Wilmington, Delaware.
His name is Dr. Pizztor.
ItaloAmerican, the name that he was just too difficult to say to a major part of the Americans, so it was going to be a Ph.P.
And the Ph.D., they were always paylon the colored and had a perfect inclined to work with children.
I was practically anything of the period that I've spent in the hospital, with the exception of sessions.
I had to do what they looked infinite repetitions with these big elastic fases, in different colors, in different colors, you know, to help me build the muscles of legs.
And I hate these more than everything.
I hate them, I really hate them, really hate them.
And, you know, I already knew already treating, like one of five years, with the Dr. P to try to go down from these exercises, and I'm going to go from these exercises, and I knew.
And one day, a day, came to one of my seats and inexorable, these seats.
and he said, "wow, Aimee, you're a young girl so strong, I think you're going to break one of those fases.
"When the rot, I'll give you 100 dollars."
Now, of course, it was just a little maneuver to make me exercises that I didn't want to do in front of being the second plan, but, what he did, was to make a different shape to be a different routine to a horrible routine day.
and turn it into an interesting experience for me.
And I wonder today, the entity of his vision, and of his declaration is about me as a young girl, he redefined my vision itself in a strong, poderly and athletic person to the future.
This is an example of how adults with power positions of power can infy the force of a child.
But, in the example of the vocabulary of the sympymous, our language's not the possibility of evolving to the reality that we would all want to do, the possibility of an individual to see itself.
Our language was not the step of the changes of our societies, many of which have been created by technology technology.
certainly, from a medical point of view, my legs, laser operations to leave the sight, knees of titanium and also receive for agrics and also to move beyond the ability that they're helping people to cooperate with their ability, and they're going to deal with the social network, and they're allowed to identify their own, so they can go to to the lose their own.
So, maybe the technology is going to revealing us now to be a truth, which each one has something rare and poderly that each one has something rare and poderly to our society, and the human ability to adapt is our largest quality.
The human ability to adapt us, is something interesting, because people have always wanted to talk to me about the tremendous and I have to tell you.
This sentence has never been well well, and I always felt that I've always heard of people to answer this, and I think I'm beginning to understand why.
It's underwear in this sentence, insmilkable, it's the idea that success, or happiness, is to come from the other side of a challenge or sign of this experience, if my success in life has come from a ability to a skills of this experience, or what people feel like my disability.
However, we're changed, we're marked, logically, by a challenge, physically or mentally both.
And I'm suggest that is a good thing.
We're not a obstacle that we need to get to fix our lives.
It's part of our life.
And I tend to think that it's like my shadow.
Sometimes I notes it very much, and sometimes almost for nothing, but it's always with me.
And, of course, I won't try to dimining the impact, the weight of the suffering of a person.
There are the adversity and challenges in life, and it's all true and it's true and it's all real and the question is not if you're going to have an adversity.
So, our responsibility is not just to protect people to us to protect people to us from the adversity, but to prepare them to the right way.
And let's make a damage to our children when we hear hear that they're not ready to adapt.
There's an important difference and distinction between the medical fact of being a person amputated and the subjective opinion of society that I'm seeing a disabled or not.
And, in truth, the only disability that I had to deal with is if the world has ever thought I could be described by those words.
In our desire to protect those who we love to address a cold, hardst, truth on their own medical projects, or, really, really, the projects of their life expectancy, we need to not put the first morning in a wall that we're going to discovery.
Maybe the existing model of just looking at what's broken in you and how to put it in place it, it can weaker the disease itself.
It's not to deal in the complete person, not to understand its potential, we're creating an unless disease.
We're actually giving a vote to the value of a person in our community.
So we have to see through the disease and inside the list of the human capability.
and, much more importantly, there's a relationship between those injuries to perceive and our creativity.
So, it's not about the security of the devalue, or deny, these numbers of the things that we want to avoid or purpose, but rather to find those opportunities in a accidental.
So maybe the idea I want to explain to you is that there is no thing like to get an adversity, like to get an adversity, as you learn to use it, to use a term of fighting free, maybe even drage out of free, maybe even dancing with us.
And maybe, if we look at an accident like a natural thing and useful, and we're less suspicious from his presence.
This year, we're celebrating the doubt of Charles Darwin, and it was 150 years ago, when I write on evolution on evolution, that Darwin has illustrated, I think, the truth to the human caratter.
To say this, in another way, it's not the stronger of the miring of the mirror that survives, and it's not even the smarter, is that the most adapt to the change.
The conflict is the genesis of crazy.
From Darwin, among other things, we can recognize that the human ability to survive and develop has led by by the suffering of human spirit through human spirit.
So, again, transformation, adaptation, is our largest quality.
And perhaps, we're not going to go to proof, we don't know what we're facing.
Maybe that's what gives us to us to have a sense of constrict, a sense of your force.
So we can do a gift.
We can imagine the adversity as something more than it's more difficult.
Maybe we can see it as a change.
The adversity is a change that we don't adapted to us yet.
I think the largest adversity we created is this idea of normal normal idea. Now, who is this idea of normal now?
There's a normal normal, there's a typical. There's a typical.
And would you want to meet those poor people who were there?
I don't think right.
If we could change this paradigm from one of how to get the normality to a possibility, or potentiality, to be even a little bit more dangerous, we can understand the force of so many children, and inviting them to bring their valuable ability with the community.
The anthropologists teaches us that what we, as humans, we've always wanted to the members of the community is to be to help to contribute.
There's a evidence that in the Netherlands, 60,000 years ago, brought to the old and the subjects with preserves and the subjects with prevalence of these people were the value of the community, and the survival of these people were the value of the community: They didn't see these people like rarian and value.
A few years ago, I was in a citizenship of citizens where I grew up in the northwest of Pennsylvania.
and I was going to take a pomode of a pomodors.
It was extremely and I had trains of the cords.
I heard this guy, his voice behind me saying, "but, it's not Aimee Mullins." And I turned, "And I had no idea of who was.
And I said, "Scusi sir, we're alive? I don't remember that I've ever met." He said, "but," I didn't remember I met.
I mean, when we met us, I was going to hide from your mother. "
Risate Oh, that guy.
And, but certainly, I played a camel.
That gentleman was the Dr. Kean, a man I had met only known from my mother on that day, because clear, clearly, I came to back in two weeks.
And so, the hostetrise of my mother had gone in vacation, so the man who had been on my parents was a complete stranger for my parents.
And, because I was born without the peron, and I had the shots in the fingers in this foot, and some of the fingers in this foot, and a few in that, he had to be the messengaged.
He said, "I had to give this talk to your parents who's parents who's never walked, and you'd never had the kind of mobility that have the other children or no independent life, and you gave me a liar liar bud to me to the other infer, that I had won't walk through my childhood, a conductive journey in my school, a born of the way that I had won
that I had marched with the Girl Scout, you know, the Halloween't won't won my studio, or all of my own lives, and then they used to use them, intreating, teaching to the students of the medicine school of Hahenemed and Halloan.
And he's called this part of the course, the X, the potential of human will.
Nobody projects can keep as much as the poderly as a determinant in the quality of life of a person's life's life's life's life's.
And the Ph.D.D. continued to explain me and he said, "In my experience, unless they didn't sell it, and even if it's given a briciola of support, if it's left to the same, a child comes there."
You can see Dr. Kean changed his opinion.
It understood that there is a difference between a medical condition and what each can do with it.
And there's been a change in my thinking in the years, in this, if you asked me when I was 15 years old, if I had to have a second.
I used that kind of normality at that time.
If you ask it today, I'm not sure.
And it's because of the experiences that I had with them, not because of the experiences I had with them.
and maybe, the change in me, because I've been exposed to the most of the people who have opened me.
You see, everything you need is a person that you're showing you the epiphania of your pots, and you're going to give someone to the charts of their strength, and you're going to be able to get a door for someone at a crucial moment, you're educating the best ways.
You're teaching them to open the doors for yours.
in fact, the meaning of the word educate is from the rax of the word "which means, pull out what it's inside, to bring the potential.
So again, what's the potential that we want to take out?
There's been a case in the 1960s in Grand path, when they were passing from the middle school school.
It's called the proof continuity, "we call it" inequality here in the United States.
it means to separate students dependently dependently.
And the students with the best votes have a harder, and teachers better, exist, and teachers, and that are better, there for a period of three months, Ai students with the "they were smart.
And at the end of this period of three months, they were having the results of the results of the results of "great." And, of course, and they took the students from "Ottish" and "to the" Watch, "and this is what happened to the end of the three months.
Those who had been in school, beyond the ones that I'd leave.
The crucial part of this study was that even the teachers were decept.
The teachers didn't know it was done this change.
He was just told, this is the students from opposed, and these are the ones with insufficient.
And so it's how they started teaching them.
So, I think the real disability is to have a damaged damaged, and a spirit of damage has not hope.
You can't see the beauty.
It's no longer our natural, infant curiosity and our innate capability to imagine.
If we can support the human spirit to maintain hope, to see the beauty in the same and in others, to be imaginative and curious, to be imaginative and curious, to be imaginative and curious, although.
When the spirit has these quality, we can create new reality and new ways of being.
I'd like to leave you with a poet written from a poet, and it got me to know my friend Jacques Demboard.
and the poem is called "The God who knows just four words," Every child has met God, not the NO, but the God of NO, but the God, but the God of NO, but the God that only knows four words and continues to repeat me.
Thank you.

Some years ago, here at TED, Petere Skillman introduced a challenge of design called the marshmallow.
And the idea is very simple.
Most of four people have to build the higher tower can be able to come up alone, using 20 spaghets, a meter of tape, a tape meter of spring and a marshmallow.
The marshmallow has to the top of the tower.
And even though it's very simple, it's quite difficult, because it costring people to collaborate very quickly.
So I thought it was an interesting idea, and I've empowered it in a lab on design.
And it was a huge successful.
And since then, I've been organized about 70 labs of the world with students, designers and architects, even directors of research and Fortune development companies of Fortune 50.
There's something in this exercise that's important about the nature of collaboration, and I'd like to share some of these lessons with you.
Normally, most of the people start with orient to the task.
They're talking, you imagine what it might have, they're competing for the power, then they spend time planning, organizing.
They're going to make sketches.
It's the most of the time that's assembling the spaghets into growing and, at the end, just when the time is scade, someone coming out the marshmallow, and they're doing a step back and Ta-!
They're working.
But what's really going on, most of the time, is that the "Ta-" turn into a" Uh-oh, "because the weight of the marshmallow does the whole structure.
There's a number of people who have more moments.
They're distracting, they're destroy, and they're creatures.
And there's obviously groups that have a lot more structures, "and, among the best, there's no childhood.
And it's incredible.
As Peter says, not just create the highest structures, but they're also the highest structures.
And your question is, how is it possible? Why is it possible? Why have particular?
And Peter love to say that, "No one of the kids spent time trying to become the Spahetti SpA." Right. "Right." Right. "I'm.
They don't spend time competing for power.
But there's another reason.
And the reason is that the students are formed to find the individual best project.
And then you go.
And after, what happens is that when they put the marshmallow in the top, have no longer have time, and what happens?
The crisis.
It's familiar? Right.
What's doing differently, it's starting from the marshmallow, and they build prototyping, one after the marshmallow, and they've got to fix prototypes along the way.
The designers recognize that this kind of collaboration is the essence of iterative process.
And with every version, children have an instantaneous feedback on what works, and it doesn't work.
So the ability to work on prototyping is essential, but let's see how they work.
The media for most people is about 50 centrimeters, for the students of the economy, about half, lawyers, a better bit, but not a lot, better, better than adults.
Who's better everyone?
Architects and engineers, thank you.
99 cm is the highest structure that I've ever seen.
And why? Because they understand that triangles and the geometric geometric models are the key to build stable.
And then we have the general directors, a better bit of the media.
But here's where it gets interesting.
If you include an administrator, the group can do much better.
It's amazing. You're going to go around, you look at "Vedrai that the guy win." You can understand the ancient. "And why?"
Because they've been particularly able to agevolve.
They get the process, they understand it.
And all the groups that gesture and pay attention to improve meaning the results of the team.
special and dots of agevolation, and their combination bringing a safe success.
If you have 10 groups that are usually working well, you'll probably have six that they're going to be able to be structures.
And I tried an interesting experiment.
I thought, let's go up for a time.
I've put 10,000 dollars in software at all.
What do you think that's successful students?
What was the results?
Here's what happened.
No one of the team created a stable structure.
If one of them had built a 2.5 cm, it would take home to the premise.
Isn't it's interesting that a very strong impact?
We tried again again again the exercise with the students.
What do you think this happened?
Now they understood the value of a prototype.
The same team, the worse has become the best.
They've created the high-minor.
So it's important lessons about the nature of incentives and successful. You could ask you: Why should someone spend the time writing a marshmallow?
The reason is this: help to create digital tools and processing to help groups, video games and effects.
And what a marshshmallow is to help to identify the hidden assumptions.
Because, honestly, every project has the marshmallow, isn't it?
The challenge provides a shared experience, a common language, a common position to build a prototype.
And so, this is the value of the experience, of this simple exercise.
And who of you're interested in, it can go to marshmallowers.
It's a blog where you can give a look at how to build marshmallow.
There are training for step.
There's crazy examples from all over the world like people's correct the system.
There's also the world record.
And the most important lesson, I think, is that design is really a sport of contact.
It requires the employment of all the senses, and the use of most final reasonments, feeling and manufacturing the challenge you have in hand.
And sometimes, a small prototype of this experience is everything that's necessary to turn a moment, "uh-oh," at a moment. "
And this can really make a difference.
Thank you very much.
So let's have a machine, great, great, beautiful, in the TED style, it's a time machine.
Everybody in this room have to go.
You can go back, you can't get where you're.
And I'd be curious to know what you would choose, because I asked my friends in the last time, and everybody wants to go back.
I don't know. They want to go back to before there were the car or Twitter, or "American Idol."
I don't know.
I'm convinced that there's a kind of returning back to the illusions.
I understand it.
But I'm not part of that group, I've got to admit.
I don't want to go back, and I don't want to go back.
So I want to go into the machine and I want to go on.
This is the best time that we've been on this planet in every field that we can measure: health, cheap, mobility, mobility, mobility, detaxes of disease.
There's never been a period like this.
My grandparents died, everybody, before the 60 years old.
My grandparents were spent that number at 70.
My parents are to touch.
So it's better that's a nine at the beginning of my death.
But it's not just people like us, it's a much bigger than this.
A child was born in New Delhi can expect to live as much as the richer man in the world of 100 years ago.
Think about it. It's an amazing fact.
How does it be true?
He's killed billion people on this planet.
It's changed the demographic of the war has ever done.
If it's gone. I've gone.
We apply it. Audience.
In the rich world, diseases that threatened millions of people only a generation ago, they don't exist.
His, rosolitself, polio --
someone still knows what they're?
Vaccines, modern medicine, our ability to feed billions of people, these are triumph of the scientific method.
And according to me, the scientific method, to try the things, see if they work, change when they don't work, it's one of the big results of humanity.
These were the good news.
Unfortunately, they're the only good news because there are other problems, and they've been excited many times, for example, one of them is that, despite all we've obtained, a billion people go on this planet, every day.
This number is growing, with incredible rapidity, and it's green.
And not only, we used our creativity to fix the planet.
It's a potable land, rainforests, rainforests, natural gas: they're disappearing, and they're disappearing, and if we don't have us.
So the question is, can we do this? I think of.
I think it's clear that it's possible to produce food to feed the ground that they live on.
I think it's possible to reprovide this world of energy without this.
I really believe it, and no, it's not an illusion.
But here's the thing that keeps me up at night -- one of the things I'm holding the night.
We've never needed scientific progress as we need to do now, and we've never been in the position of using them as we could today.
We're an incredibly step from very incredible events, really, in many ambites.
But despite this, I think we should go back centuries, 300 years, before the Illuminism, to find a period where we've been fighting the progress, a period of time where we're doing now.
People are trapped in what they believe, and they're doing it with a lot of strength that we can't get liberate.
In the truth manages to liberate them.
Listen, everybody has rights to their opinion; they're even going to the opinion, but you know what don't you?
You don't have your facts. I'm sorry, you can't.
I put it a little bit to understand it.
A decine years ago, I wrote a story about the New Yorker vaccines for "The New Yorker, an article.
And I was amazing that someone opposite, which was contrary to what it is, after all, the measure of public health care of all the human history.
I didn't know what to do, so I've been writing the story and spent another.
Not much later, I've written a story about genetically modified food.
It's just bigger.
People were impaired.
So I've written a story about that, and I couldn't understand why people consider the OGM like "food show," because they thought that moved specific molecules, rather than to go to the work of nature.
But, as always, I'm doing my job. I wrote the story and I went forward.
I mean, I'm a journalist: Let's go down.
But these stories were tortured and I couldn't understand why, but at the end of it.
The problem was that those fanatic fanatical fanatics were not at all.
They were people of consciousness, education, people for good.
They were just like people in this room.
And the thing was very disturbing --
but then I thought, we've got to be honest; we're at a point, on this planet, where we don't have the same relationship with progress that there was a time.
We're talking in a way.
We're talking in terms of irons using virgolette: "Progress," All right, there are reasons to do it, and I think we know what they're.
We've lost trust in institutions, in authority, and sometimes in the science itself, and it's understandable.
You just do some names and people understand.
Chernobyl, the Challenger, Vioxx, weapons of mass, election elections.
I mean, each one has his list.
We have questions and problems with the people we thought we were always right.
So you're skeptical.
You're tomorrow, pretend evidence.
Don't tell anything.
But here's the fundamental point: when the evidence comes necessary, and we're not very good in this.
And I think that the reason is that we're in an epidemic that I've never seen and I've never seen.
About 12 years ago, it was published a story, a very horrible story, which was supported of autism and and males.
Very frightening.
Hundreds of studies were made to see if it was true.
And you had to do hundreds of studies; it's an important issue.
And they finally got the data.
The United States from the United States, from Sweden, from Sweden, from Canada, and everybody was equal, no connection, no correlation, no correlation, nothing.
It didn't have a difference. It didn't do it, because we think we're seeing, what we think we're seeing, what it makes us hear.
We don't believe a plant documents of the government employees showing us numbers, and I understand it, and I understand that, I think we all understand it.
But you know what?
The results were devastating --
device because this is a fact: The United States are one of the few countries in the world where the number of vaccines against the world in which the number of vaccines against the morning.
It's horrible, and we're going to be proud of ourselves.
It's terrible.
What's happened that's happening?
Now, I understand it. I understand it really.
Think about it, someone here's bills?
Anyone of the audience have never seen a person who's died?
It doesn't happen.
In this country doesn't happen, but it's 160,000 times in the world last year.
I'm a little bit of deaths, 20 every time.
But since he didn't happen here, we can take it from your head, and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around to shoot messages and ignorance from palcoscenes like Oprah or Larry King Live.
And they can do it because they can't understand the difference between causality and correlation.
They don't understand that these two things seem equal, but they're never.
But it's something we need to learn, and we need to learn it quickly.
This man was a hero, Jonas Salk.
It's the humanity from one of its worse flags.
No fear, no fear.
The man at the center, not as well.
It's called Paul Offit.
It's just created a vaccine at other people.
It's 400, 500 thousand children every year in developing countries.
I mean, right?
It's good, if it wasn't that Paul's going around to talk about vaccines, he says how valuable people should simply stop.
And he says in these terms.
So Paul is considered a terrorist.
When Paul: When Paul talks in a public humor can't address without an armed armed.
They're calling it at home because they like memories who know where his children go to school.
Why? Because Paul has created a vaccine.
I wouldn't need to tell it, but vaccines are fundamental.
If we can pick them up, diseases come back, terrible diseases, and it's going on.
We've got the bills in this country.
And it's going to be worse, and we don't have a lot of children's because it's just a question of numbers.
And they're not just going to die.
The polio? Let's tell us that. Why not?
One of my former colleague had written a couple of weeks ago, and he told me that I was considered a little except.
Nobody told me before.
She wouldn't vaccinated with polio.
It's even death.
OK.
Why? Because there's no polio from us. But you know what?
We had no polio in the United States.
Today, I don't know -- maybe you're sitting on an airplane in Lagos and it's coming to Lagos Angeles, now it's Ohio.
Maybe it's going to land a couple of hours, it's going to notice a machine, that's here in Long Beach and they're going to go to Long Beach and they're going to be a couple of hours,
He doesn't know that I've been infected by a paralyzing disease, and we don't know that it's how the world works.
This is the planet where we live.
We love to surrounding us. Let's do this.
You're all taken vitamin?
Echeck, a little bit of antioxdide to start the day.
I know you did this because half of the Americans do this every day.
They take that stuff stuff, as they rate to the alternative medicine, and it doesn't matter how often they're inuseful they're useless.
The data is always demonstrates it.
It's more dark. It's not doing, almost never.
But it's okay, you want to spend 28 billion dollars.
Urina. It's cure.
Why do we do that? Why?
I think we've got the big drug houses.
Let's see the great government machine. We don't trust us.
And let's do well. Our healthcare system.
It's cruel to millions of people.
It's absolutely, incredibly cold and demoralizing for those of us that can afford.
So we didn't get away away from it?
We're alone of the big placebo.
It's great. We love the big placebo.
You know, it's a serious problem because this stuff is a slavor, and we spend billions of dollars.
I have a bunch of examples here.
No one of these knee kgo -- a frode, echinacea -- a frode, echinacy -- I don't know what it's, but it's a fraud.
You know what? When I say these things, people screening me against, and they say, "But what's interested in? Lascia that people do what they want.
It's good. "
You know what? You're going back.
Because I don't care if it's the secret of the Department for the Service and the Service and the Service, I don't want to listen to the evidence of mama "or if he says some long of the patients in the coffee.
When we imboard the street that brings to remit science and evidence with magic and tradition, we end in a place where we wouldn't want to be.
Let's end like Thabo in South Africa.
He's killed 400 mile of his concitizens continuing to say that bars were working best of the anti-retroviral drugs that we know can sdown the AIDS.
Hundreds of thousands of inuseful deaths in a nation that's been struck more than every other than this disease.
Please, you don't tell me that there are no consequences.
There are. There are always.
Now, the most stupid epidemic that we're in the middle right now is the war's that we're in the middle of the biological food.
It's an idiot. It's got to end.
It's a diatrist on the words, on the metaphor.
It's ideology, it's not science.
Every single thing we eat, every chick of rise, every chick of Bruxells, every Bruxells of Brxelles was modified by the man.
You see, they weren't send in the garden of Eden.
There were no melanzees.
There were not even Christmas trees. We created them.
We did this over the last 111,000 years.
Something worked and something worked and something else.
And we've eliminated what he didn't work.
Now we can do it more precise.
And there are some risks, of course there are.
But we can put things like vitamin A in rise, and this would help millions of people, providing their lifetime.
And we don't want to do that?
I've got to tell you, I don't understand it.
We're in the OGM.
Why?
The things that I've always hear is: too many chemicals, pesticides, hormones, we don't want to be massive with the same, it's wrong.
We don't want the company to put patents on life.
We don't want that the companies are uniquetary.
You know what's my answer to this?
It's yes. You're right. Let's.
It's true, we have a huge food problem, but it's not science.
It has nothing to do with science.
It's law, morality, morality.
You know that science is not a corporation.
It's not a nation.
It's not even an idea; it's a process.
It's a process, sometimes it's a process, sometimes it's idea that we wouldn't afford science to do his work, because we're afraid's pushing to millions of people to try.
You know, in the next 50 years we're going to be forced to produce 70 percent of the food in more than we produce now, 70 percent.
These are the investments in Africa in the last 30 years.
Vergognose.
They need and we don't need them.
Why? His genetically modified.
We don't want to encourage people to eat feet like.
There's a billion people eat it.
It looks a little bit.
But it gives it only calories. It's slave.
It doesn't have nutrients, it doesn't have protein, but scientists are found how to put it in this moment.
And so many people could eat the least the risk of becoming blind.
They wouldn't die hunger, and you know what?
It would be very good. It wouldn't be a restaurant, but it would be great.
I'd say to me, why are we against?
I mean, let's say, let's do that?
Just why don't we want to move genes and there?
It's about moving genes. It's not about chemicals.
It's not about our ridiculous obsession for hormones, or our desire to have bigger food, better.
There's no Krispies.
It's about saving people's life, and it's now that we started to understand what it is.
Because -- if we don't understand it? -- if we don't understand it, and we're going to go now, we're going to be guilty, technological colonialism.
There's no other way of describe what's going on.
It's selfish, it's in front of us, and we have to stop it.
So, after this, funny conversation, you might ask me, "Do you want to go into this ridicle of time and go to the future?"
Of course I want.
It's stuck on the present now, but we have an incredible opportunity.
We can put the machine of time as we want.
We have the chance of going to where we want, and we're going really going to where we want.
We've got to do these conversations, and we need to think, but when we're going to be happy to do it.
I know that we can and, as it's about, I think the world of it immediately.
Thank you.
Thank you.
One day, the Los Angeles Times Steve Lopez was walking for for the streets of the center of Los Angeles when he heard a beautiful music.
He came from a man, a man, an African-American man, fascinating, fascinating, without dimnow, who played a violin which had only two cords.
I'm telling a story that many of you know, because the Steve's articles, because the articles of a book, which I'm going to take a big screen, with Robert Downey Jr who interpret the part of Steve Lopez, and Jamie Foxylist to the part of Nathaniel Anony Ayers, the ophrenewed career to the Juilliard to the Juilliard I'm promid.
Nathaniel leave the Juilliard, he had a terrible expanded, and 30 years later, 30 years later she lived as a no roof for the streets of Skid Row in the center of Los Angeles.
I've all been reading the book of Steve or look at the film to understand not just the beautiful lead that created between these two men,
My name is Jane McGonigal. I'm a games of video games.
It's about 10 years old and my goods for the next 10 years is to try to make it easy to save the world in the real world in the world of online games.
To do that I have a plan, and it's a plan, and in convincing more people, including a lot of time playing more beautiful and interesting games.
We're three billion hours at the time we're playing online.
Some of you might think, "It's a lot of time playing."
maybe too long, looking at how many urgent problems we need to solve the real world.
In fact, in my research, at the Istitute for the Future, actually is the contrary.
Three billion hours a week aren't sufficient enough to solve the most urgent problems in the world.
In fact, I think that if we want to survive the next century on this planet, we've got to increase remarkable.
I calculated that the total we need is 21 billion hours of play every week.
It's probably a counterintuitive argument, so the repeat, so the repeat, to reinforce the concept.
If we want to solve that hunger, poverty, global conflicts, global conflicts, the obesity, the obesity, I think we have to have the environment to play online, for at least 21 billion hours, for at least 21 billion hours at the end of the next decade. No, I'm, really serious.
That's why. This picture reassume because I think it's so important for the survival of the species.
This is a portrait of the Phil Toldano, wanted to capture the emotion of the game.
So she photographed the players as they were playing.
And this is a classic emotion of game.
If you're not abitual players is possible that you're losing some of this photograph.
You can probably see the sense of urgency, a little bit of fear, but also an intention to a very difficult problem.
If you're players, you will notice some detail, you'll notice some details, and around the mouth is a sign of optimism.
And the eyebrow will show surprise.
This is an abitual player a step from something called a "Except."
Ah, it's a term that you've heard. Okay.
So we've got abitual players between us.
It's a remarkable results that's so extraordinarily positive that doesn't seem to when you don't get it.
It's almost over the imagination of imagination, and when there's a shock to discover what you're capable. That's a life.
It's a step at a step from an epic lives.
And that's the expression that we need to see in the face of millions of resolutions in the world as we're facing the next hundred years.
Unfortunately, that's the expression we see in life of every day while we're treating with urgent problems.
That's the expression that I call "I'm" I'm not Brate. "And I'm going to do it.
It's me with the expression, "I'm not Bring."
This is a degree in my old neighborhood of Berkeley, in California, where I did the PhD in California, where I did the PhD on because we're more good at the game in the game.
And that's a problem that's a problem. We're feeling that we're not good as in games.
And I don't mean "good," even if the success is part of this: we get more results in online worlds.
But I also "good" in the sense of motivate to do something important, inspiring to collaborate and cooperate.
And when we're in an online world, I think that many of us become the best versions of ourselves, the more capable of helping, more capable of focus, more capable of focus on a problem for all the time, to get up after a failure and try again.
And in real life, when we're facing a failure, when we face a obstacle, we often don't hear that we're feeling, we feel anxious, maybe it's frustrated or movie.
We're never feelings when we're playing, they just don't exist in a game.
So this is what I wanted to study to university.
So what's that in a game that we can't get any results?
How can we lead those feelings and apply the real world?
So I've studied games like the World of Warcraft, which is really the ideal environment to solve collaborative.
And I started to notice some of the things that make so possible in the online worlds.
The first is that, when it's in one of these online games, especially in the World of Warcraft, there's a lot of different characters a mission to rescue the world. Fin immediately.
But it's not a mission: an perfectly adequate your current level in the game. Right?
So you can complete it.
They're not going to give you a challenge.
But it's the limits of your skills. So you've got to be seriously.
But there's no employment in World of Warcraft, you don't pass the polls, it's always something specific and important to do.
And there's a lot of collaborators.
Whatever you're there, hundreds of thousands of people, ready to join your mission.
It's not a common thing that's in real life, this feeling that we have a lot of collaborators.
And there's this narrative storm, this narrative that inspire, because we're there, and what we're doing.
And then we get this positive feedback --
You've heard that we've heard of strength and ths one in intelligence.
We don't get that kind of constant feedback in real life.
When I leave this stage, I wouldn't happen to speak in front of a audience, and + 1 in ideas.
I don't get that type of feedback in real life.
Now, the problem of collaborative environments online like the World Warcraft is that it so much satisfaction is that it so much satisfaction is that it so much satisfacing all the moments, that we decide to spend all our time in these games of play.
It's just better than reality.
It's why, until now, collectively all the players of the World Warcraft players spent 5.93 million years to solve Azeroth.
That's not necessarily a negative thing.
But let's put it in perspective: 5.93 million years ago was the time when one of our ancestors stood up.
That's the first one to walk.
Okay, so when we're talking about how much time we're investing in playing, the only way to think about it, it's to talk about it, it's an extraordinary, but also useful, because we found that passing all this time to play, we're changing what we're, we're changing what we
This is true, I think.
So that's interesting statistics.
It was recently published by a researcher at Carnagie Mellon.
The middle typical young average today today in a country with a strong citizenship players, they've spent 10,000 hours playing online, at the age of 21.
10,000 hours is a number decision for two reasons.
First of all, for children in the United States 10.080 hours, it's the number of hours that I passes to school from the room to grade to the murity if you're present every day.
So we've got a whole path of parallel education in which young people learn how to be some of the players ♪
And some of you will have probably read the new book of Malcolm Gladwell, "Fulm."
If you're going to read about his theory of success, the theory of the 10,000 hours for success.
It's founded on a very good research in the cognition, which says that if we're dediculous 10,000 hours of the study that we're going to be genes in that field.
We're going to be good in that something as the best people in the world.
So, what we've now now is a whole generation of young people who are the genes of the game.
So, the question is, "Exactly, what's going on."
because if we could understand what's happening we'd be disposition of human resources.
This is the number of people in the world that's at least a day to play online.
These are our game genes.
500 million people who are extraordinarily brave -- in something.
And in the next decade, we're going to have another billion.
If you already don't know it, that's what you're expected to us: the video game industry is developing platforming platforms of the Internet, in particular, China's players all over the world, in particular in India, China, Brazil, they can connect them online.
It's a billion player in the next decade players in the next decade.
This is going to bring us to 1.5 billion players.
So I started to think about what games are transforming us into genes.
These are four aspects that I've been detected. The first is a optimism.
Okay. Think of that as a form of self-motivation.
A optimism is the wish to act immediately to address an obstacle, together with the belief of having a reasonable hope of success.
The abitual players believe that an epic vittory's possible and value it's all the time to try, and try right now.
The abitual players aren't hands in their hands.
The abitual players are virtuous in the track of social robust.
There's a lot of interesting research that show how we're better people after they've played with other people after playing with them, even though they fat us.
And the reason is that it takes a lot of trust to play with someone: we have trust that they're going to spend their time with us, who will play with the same rules, and they're going to the conclusion of the game.
So, they're playing together with trust and cooperation.
We have more robust social relationships.
I love.
You know, there's a reason for the World Warcraft's player 22 hours a week, almost as a job.
It's because we know, as we're playing, that we're doing, which we're going to be happily working or losing time.
We know that we're optimized, like being human, to work on something that's meaning.
And the abitual players are willing to work constantly, if it's assigned a task.
And finally, one epics meaning.
The abitual players love to be associated with wonder, human stories about scale.
For example, a small information to help create context.
You're all Wikipedia, the largest wiki in the world.
The second wiki's largest wiki in the world, with almost 80,000 articles is the World of Warcraft.
They filled more information on the World of Warcraft in the Internet, that on any other issue in any other wiki in the world.
They're building an epic opera.
They're building a foundation of the World of Warcraft.
Okay, these are the four superpowers that together.
The abitual players are great super-powers of great super-powers.
These are people who believe they're individually able to change the world.
The only problem is they believe they're able to believe that they're capable to change the virtual worlds.
That's the problem I'm trying to solve.
There's an economy called Edward Castronova.
His studies are brilliant. It's studying why people invest so much time, energy and money, in online worlds.
He says, "We're looking at what we're seeing less that a mass of mass towards the virtual and the environments of game."
And it's a economy, so it's rational, and he says -- not like me, I'm a game designer, I'm exubering --
But he says that this is a perfectly feeling that this is perfectly sensed, because the abitual players can get more in the online worlds that in real life.
They can have more solid social relationships in a game that's not in real life.
They need a better feedback, and they hear more reward in a game that doesn't live in the real life.
So, say, right now, it's perfectly reasonable for the players, to spend more time in virtual worlds that in the real world. And I agree that this is reasonable now, but it's not, a ideal situation, but it's not, a ideal situation.
There's something that's happening 2,500 years ago.
They're dads, facts of pecora Prim to have wonderful joyhicks and cleaner we had bones of sheep. And these represents the first tools out of humanity.
You know, you know, if you know, historian, maybe you know, you know, this story.
It's the story of who invented the games and why.
Erodot that games, particularly dade games, were invented in the rules of the Lidia, during a period of load.
It's so several, that the king of the Lidia decided to do something unthinkable.
People suffered, the population was in laughing, it was extremely, they needed an extreme solution.
So, according to Erodote, invented the games of dads and emanded a very valid.
One day, everybody would eat.
The next day, everybody would play.
And they immersed so deeply in dade games, from the moment that play is so engaged, and they immerge in a state of playful productivity, that ignored the fact to have nothing to eat.
And so one day they played, and one day.
And according to Erodoto, they passed up a day and playing that next day and playing that next day and playing that next.
I think that's exactly the way we use games at the day.
We use games to escape of the real world suffering.
We're using games to get away from everything that doesn't work in our real environment, from all that we don't satisfy of real life, and we get what we need from games.
But we don't need to stop here.
That's really interesting: according to Erodote, after 18 years, the carestia didn't talk to improving, so that they're going to do.
They became the whole kingdom in half, they played a dadi, and the winners of that partners participate in an epic participation.
They'd go, and they went to search of a new land where to live, and left behind the good enough of people to survive with the resources, with the hoping of their civilization from some other side, where they could could try.
It's a little bit bizarre, right?
However, because of the DNA have revealed that the Etruses who would then bring to the rohands, sharing the same DNA of the old people in the Lidia.
And so recently, scientists have suggested that the story restored by Erodote is a real story.
And geologists have found evidence of a global cooling for almost 20 years and that could explain the heart.
So this incredible story might be true: they'd actually rescue their culture playing, refugees in games for 18 years, and then be so inspired, and know so well how to come up with the whole civilization.
Okay, we can do that even.
"Warcraft from Warcraft since 1994.
It was the first game in real time strategy of World Warcraft. This 16 years ago.
And they played for 18 years, we've played in Warcraft for 16.
I say, we're ready for our game.
They'd half the people in the journey to search for a new world.
It's where the idea of 21 billion hours of play a week.
So let's show that half of us would agree to get an hour a day to play, until we solve the real world's problems.
I imagine what you're to ask, "How do we solve the real problems of the real world in a game?" Well, that's what I've been dedicated for the Futall.
In our offices of the Palo's offices that express our own idea of how we should relationship with the future.
We don't want to try to predict the future.
What we want to do is -- the future.
We want to imagine the scenaries from the best results and then we want to give people chance to transform them actually.
We want to imagine victories and then give people the tools to make them.
I'm going to show you briefly three games that I realized and that I'm an attempt to people to make the tools to create victories in their future.
This is "Petrolio."
We made this game in 2007.
It's an online game in which is trying to survive a oil.
It's not real, but we've published sufficient online to believe that it's, and to make life real as if we're going to sit. So, when you go into the game, the records, and they show exactly the cost of oil, the things that are not available, the cost of oil, the things that aren't available to the distribution of food.
the impact on the transportation, if the schools are clear, if there's rich, and you've got to think of how you're going to ask you to have a blog on, to publish video, to publish pictures -- to publish pictures...
We've had this game with 1,700 players in 2007, and we looked at them since then for the three years, and what I can say is that it's a experience that transform.
Nobody wants to change the way in which is just because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing.
But if they immerged them in an epic and say, "We don't have any oil.
That's an incredible story!
It's yourself to see how to survive. "
Most of our players then kept the habits that learned in the game.
So, for the next game to save the world, we decided to rescue the world, we decided to a higher problem of oil.
We made a game called Superstruct, at the Istitute, and the premise was: a supercomputer calculated that the humanity was only 23 years on this planet.
The supercomputer was called "Sistema Global Estination." Of course. "Of course."
We asked people to come online almost like Jerry Bruckheimer film.
You know Jerry Bruckheimer, ants a team from dream: There's a team from dream: There's apos;s an astronauty, and they all have something to do to save the world, but in our game, but in our game, instead of having only only only only five people in the team from the team, everybody is part of the team, and that's the future of security and the future of security, the future of health and previously.
8,000 people have played for eight weeks, they've generated 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can find if you go online and looking for Google "Superstruct."
And finally, the last game, will start the three. This is a game with the three. This is a game with the Istitute of the World Bank.
If you complete the game, you're going to be certificate from the World Bank, as the Social Innovator, class of 2010.
If you work with the sub-Saharan Africa, we're inviting them to learn the techniques of social innovation.
There's a smoking story, you're increases of a level, collaboration, sustainability, collaboration, sustainability, imagination and invent.
Let's inviting all of you sharing this game with young people, everywhere in the world, particularly in the developing world, particularly in the areas in the developing world.
It's now to conclude.
I want to ask a question.
What are you going to happen?
We have all these incredible players, we've got these games that are plants of what we could do, but no one of these has still saved the real world.
Well, I hope you can agree with me that the abitual players are a human resources that we can use to do work in the real world, that games are a powerful platform for the change, that we have these incredible superpowers, a real platform for the change, that we have these incredible superpowers, a justice and the wish of meaning.
I really hope that we can sell us to play with games that have importance, to survive on this planet for another century, and my hope is is that joined you in me in making and participate with games like this.
When I look forward at the next decade, of two things are certain: that we can make any future we can imagine, and that we can play any future we can play.
So, I say, let's start to the games that will change the world.
Thank you.
For some time, I've been interested in the placebo effect, it may seem like a weird thing that a magician if you're in my point of view, and that's "something" fake "In other words, the please have a measure effect,
that what's happening is to a drug or something similar --
And the therapy of the pain, for example, if they believe you have a measurable effect in the body called placebo effect.
What's becomes something true for the perception that if it has.
To understand, I want to show you a wheel trick, very simple.
And I'm going to show you how it works. That's a trick that's present in all the books for children in the 191950s.
I learned it only with Cub Scout Magic in the years.
I'm going to expect it for you, and so I'll explain it.
And so I'm going to explain why I explained you.
That's what happens.
The knife, you can look at.
I'm going to just the knife in my clear, so.
I'm on the manics.
It's to be sure that's not going to go from my hands.
Now string my wrist so.
And so you can see that you can't see something that's going to go on or down from my manics.
And the purpose of this is simple.
I'm going to open my hand, and if everything went well, my animal magnetism will track the knife.
In fact, I'm actually going to go to the place, and the knife don't fall.
Nothing on or down from my manics.
no trick. You can look anything.
Two!
This is a trick that often often teach to children.
that they're interested in magic, because you can learn a lot about British even if you'll learn a lot about the trick, but it's very simple.
A lot of you're going to know this trick.
That's what happens in my hand.
I suppose my wrist.
to make sure that nothing goes up or down from my manica, that's a lie.
The reason I'm holding the wrist is because it's the secret of illusion.
And in the moment that my hand is moving away from you, this finger here, my indetection here was, in a position that he was, in a position that!
There's someone who didn't have an childhood here.
It's like this, right here, right.
And when I went out.
We can talk about why it's deception, because you don't just notice that there's just three fingers, and the way you get the information, not count, one, two.
But that's not the point. Right? And when I open my hand, Obviously remain attached not through the animal magnetism, but through the English magnetwork here.
And when I close my finger, itself back, this movement covers the fingers.
My hand. The knife is away.
It's a trick you can do with your friends and neighbors. Thank you.
Now, what does this with placebo effect?
I read a study, a year ago that's shown me.
I'm not a doctor or a researcher, so it was a surprising thing.
It looks like if you're a placebo in the shape of the white, it's like an aspirin, and it has a measure.
But if you change the shape and you give the placebo, in the form of a smaller pile, and you print a letter is more effective visibly.
Even if there's no drug -- they're pills.
But a white bank is not effective as a blue blue pill.
What? It really really did me.
But anyway, it's not here that end up.
The capsures are more effective of fairly.
A hit, that's yellow, who's yellow and rosses from the other is better than a capsule.
The dosage has a role.
It's a twice twice a day is not so effective as three pills -- now I don't remember the statistics. Scuse.
But the point is --
that these doses have a role.
And it also has a role.
And if you want the definitive placebo you have to use a needle.
Right? It's a syringe with something -- a couple.
You inject it in a patient --
This is a picture so strong in their mind, much stronger of the white of the pill.
It's real, this graph -- don't show you another time when we're on the slide.
The point is that the white pill isn't effective as the blue that's not effective as a needle.
And no one of these has a drug quality.
It's just your believe that makes them real in your own and strength the effect.
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and apply it to a magic trick.
And doing something that's a finance trick and make it look like real.
And we know from the study that when you want a effect needs to use.
That's a fillon Finch.
It's a little bit.
This is my meat. This isn't special from Damian.
This is my skin. This is not a special hollywoods.
I'm going to bucking my skin and get this.
If you try nausea -- if you don't easily -- I did for some friends in the tree, the other night, and for some that I didn't know, and a woman is almost sent.
So if you try nausea easily, suggesting you don't look for the next 30s -- actually, you know, I'm going to do the first part here.
You can see, you can look at another side.
That's what's happening here, I'm going to have just a little hole.
Sorry. Are you impression?
And now a little bit through my skin, and out of the other side, so that.
Now, we're in the same position of the knife.
More or less, you can't get my fingers now, right?
So I'll show you. Here's one, two, four, five. Yeah, well...
I know what people think when they see.
They think, "You're going to wouldn't be so stupid from the skin just for a few minutes."
So, let me give you a beet.
How does it look? It's good.
Yeah, I know there'll say, "OK, I didn't see it well."
People in rooms are entering.
I'm going to show you.
This is really my skin. It's not a special effect of Hollywood.
This is my meat, and I can turn it around.
Sorry, if you hear you look away from another side, you don't look.
People at the bottom or they're going to look at a few years to say, "Well, it's clear that they're going to --
You can see there's a hole here and a hole here, if it was true. "
Well, now I get a little bit of blood for you.
That's here.
Normally now levers the needle.
I'd like my arm, and I'd see that there's no stop.
But I believe that in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and turn it into something that's true, and I'm going to let me go from the stage.
We're going to see several times in the next days I don't see the hour.
So in my life I met a lot of fish.
I've love two.
The first one, it was more than a passional story.
It's a nice heavy, carnose, which is one of the most sold on the menu.
which fish!
It's even better, it's the most elevated standard of the most elevated standard of environmental sustainability.
So, you hear a place with consciousness to sell it.
I was involved in a relationship with this beauty for several months.
One day, the head of the company called me and asked me to talk about a dedicated event of environmental sustainability.
"Of course," I said. "
This was a company that tried to solve what became an unimaginable problem for our chef.
How do we continue to have fish in our menu?
During the last 50 years we've been wearing in the mari in the same way that we've got to the soil.
The destruction was tremendous.
90 percent of the big fish, the ones that like so much the tons, the halids, the room, the fish, the weapons, the fish came out of the number.
There's almost nothing.
So, for us or not the water, the fish, the farming of fish, it's going to become part of our future.
There's a lot of topics.
There's a fish that's less the greater part of them, and they're inefficient, and they're inefficient.
A big problem is that there is a food rate of 15 to one.
That means that it takes 15 wildlife fish to get a wildlife fish to get a libbra.
It's not very sustainable.
And it's not a great thing.
Here's, finally there was a company that tried to do the right way.
I wanted to help them.
The day first of the event of public public public relationship.
Let's call it Don.
"Don," I said, "you're famous to understand, you're famous to make alone."
"Exactly," he said, "We're so far away from the coast that our shoots are being didn't focus."
And then she said, "We're basically a world."
"The conversion rate? 2.5 to a" he said. "
"The best in the sector."
2.5 to one, great.
"2.5 to one thing? What do you eat fish?"
"sustainable Proteine, he said.
"Great," I said. "And I said.
That night, I was in bed, I thought, but what the hell is a sustainable protein?
So the day latest first of the event, I've called Don's still called Don.
I said, "Don, do you make some sustainable protein?"
He said he didn't know it, and he would ask.
Well, I'm talking to a little bit of people in the company and none of them and no one response.
That's until I'm talking with biologist.
We also call him Don.
"Don," I said, "Do you do?"
Well, he'll mentioned a few fish eat me, and then he said, "Believe chicken."
I said, "Chicken?"
He said, "Yes, don't, don't, you know, shoes and don't eat me."
I said, "What percentage of your eat is made of pollo?"
I'd say, two percent.
"Well, it's about 30 percent."
I said, "Don, what's sustainable to give the fish of the pollo to eat?"
There was a long pause on the telephone and then said, "there's too many chickens in the world."
I'm sorry about this fish.
No, because I'm not because they're one of those virtuous and traditional food.
Well, to say the truth is.
No, in fact, I'm sorry about this fish because, I've got it after that conversation, the fish knew of chicken.
The second fish is a different story.
It's a romantic story that kind of history that kind of knows the fish and more love.
I ate it for the first time in a restaurant in the south of Spain.
One of my friend journalist had been talking about this fish.
It's basically meet.
He went to the table, he had a brilliant white color, almost scintiming.
The chef had cot too.
It's basically twice as much as it had to be cot.
Incredibly, it was right.
Who's capable of making a fish so good after they're doing it?
I don't, but this guy yes.
Let's call it Miguel.
It's actually called Miguel.
No, he didn't have the fish, and it's not a chef.
For the less, it's not in the sense that we're going to usually.
It's a biologist in Veta Palma that's a fish that's a fish that's in the world's side of the river's river.
In the '80s's's managed from Argentini.
They had belonges on what they'd been essentially a paludosa.
They'd give the earth building a series of channels, so the water in the river.
Well, they couldn't work out of the economic point of view.
And, from the ecological point of view, it was a disaster.
He had killed something like 90 percent of birds and, looking at the place, it's a lot of birds.
So in 1982, in 1982, an environmental consciousness with an environmental consciousness.
What do they do?
They're going to come up.
literally, invert the switch.
Instead of trying to meet the water away from the ground, they used channels to put it.
They're all the channels.
They made a lot of fish alevent from 27 mile spigle, die gambers, anguel and in this process, Miguel and in this process, Miguel and this company and the invertiring completely the ecological destruction.
It's incredible.
I mean, it's never seen something like this.
Let's look at the horizon that it seems to be away from a million miles and everything that you see is the inondata and this rich, money.
I've been there recently with Miguel.
It's an incredible type three quarters Darwin and a fourth Crocodile Dundee.
Okay?
First, I'm looking at a weather.
And then he explains the mineral necessity of the planoplankton and then see a kind of fish of fish that reminds him of Tanzania.
And outside Miguel has spent a lot of his career at the National Park Mikumi in Africa.
I asked him how he became a fish expert.
He said, "Pesci? I know nothing fish.
I'm an expert in relationships. "
And it's still in the speech of birds, algae and strange plants.
Don't get me wrong, all this was very fascinating, that's a very fascinating community.
It's interesting, but I was in love.
And my head kept trying to rethink about that.
So the interrupp and said, "Miguel, what makes your fish so good?"
He indicated the algae.
"I know, the algae, the fitplankton, the relationships, yes, the relationships, yes, it's incredible.
But your fish fish fish are eating?
What's your food conversion of conversion?
Well, they're telling me about how they're a rich system so rich that the fish would eat exactly what they're sending in a wild environment.
The plant biomass, the plankton, the zooplankton, is all the fish.
The system is so health that's completely self-renova.
There's no eat me.
Did you've ever heard about a training training the animals?
And then later, I was driving around the ground with Miguel and I said, "In a place like this soil that looks so natural different from any alevation that I've ever seen, how do you happen?"
At that precise moment, it was as if the regist of a film had ordered the change of set.
We Gird the angle and see a scene between the most incredible thousands and thousands of red fenicothers and thousands of red faces a red real rose that was lost to eye's eye.
"That's the success, he said."
"Look at their pance, they're red.
They're planning. "
Banching? I was completely confused.
I said, "Miguel, but are don't they're on your fish?"
"Yes," he said. "
"Okay, let's about 20 percent of the fish and eggs for birds.
Last year on this properties there were 600,000 birds.
Today it's become the largest and one of the most important private healthcare for birds in Europe. "
I said, "Miguel, but a population of bird is not the last thing you want in a fish farm?"
He knows her head, no.
He said, "We're going to extend.
This is a ecological network.
The fends eat eat the legs.
Tribers eatoplankton.
So, it's red the trust of the fenifly better is the system. "
OK, then let's reassume: A training that we don't eat his animals and measurement in the health of its predators.
It's a fish training, but also a healthcare for birds.
Ah, by the way, those faces shouldn't even have to be there.
They do the nest in a town 150 miles where the conditions are better for the building of nest.
Every morning, they're flying for 150 miles, and every night, they make 150 miles for the back.
They're doing it because they're capable of following the A92.
On the night.
I would imagine something like penguins so I looked at Miguel.
And I said, "Miguel, they're flying for 150 miles to go back?
Do they do it for them? "
It looked at me as if I had just mentioned a song of Whitney Houston.
He said, "No, they do it because food is better."
I didn't talk about the skin of my fish that was delizious, and I usually don't like the skin of the fish.
I don't like to hug, I don't like crash.
It's that knows, as asphase.
Don't almost ever cook.
And yet, when I hike it in that south of the south of the south of the Spain.
He had a sweet knows and clean was like to give a dead sor to the ocean.
I said this in Miguel, and he annoyed.
He said, "The skin is as a waste.
It's the last defense before all of the fish bodies.
It's evolved to deal. "
And then she said, "But our water doesn't have unit."
Okay. It's a training fish.
It's a extremely success about his predators.
And then I realize that when he says that it doesn't have didn't have a lot of minimizing a lot of the things that the river is that it's a river who's a river who's a river that brands of pesticide.
And when it goes down the system, and it's more clear than when it's gone.
The system is so healthcare, the water.
So, it's not just a farmer that doesn't just a training that measure its predators, but an alevation that's literally a purification of water and not only for those fish, but also for me and for you.
Because when the water goes into the Atlantic.
It's a drop in the ocean, but I know the welcome, but I'm going to do even because this story of love as romantics is also instructive.
You might say that it's a recipe for the future of good food is that you're talking about fish.
What we're now need is a radically new conception of agriculture in which food is really good.
But for many people, this is a bit too radical.
We're not realists, we're passionate about food.
We're love.
Let's addressing small farmers.
We love the little family faces.
Let's talk about local territory food.
Let's look at the biological.
And when you tell those are the things that will make sure the future of good food, somewhere, and they say, "Hey you're going to say," Hey, "you," I can feed the whole world? "
How do you think we can feed the world? "
Can I be max?
It's a question I don't like.
No, it's not because we're already producing enough to feed the world.
One billion people suffer the hunger today.
There's a billion -- more than we've ever been -- because of huge inequality in the distribution.
You see, I don't like this question, because it has determined the logic of our food system in the last 50 years.
Dare cereals to the pesticide's monocultures, chemicals with the fish and all this time the agricultures and all this time the agricultures, just asked, "What is we do?"
This was motivation.
It was the justification.
It was the American agriculture business plan.
We'd have to call it for what's, a liquidation industry that's just quickly heroding capital that makes the same production possible.
This is not an industry, and it's not agriculture.
Our panies today's threatened not because of ants in dimination, but for the resources in diminution, not for the last mechanics, but for fresh water, not for the last mechanics, but for fresh water doesn't get the fish, but for the forests and the fish, but for the fish and the fish, but for the fish and the fish, but for the fish in the sea.
Do you want to feed the world?
So let's start asking us, how are we going to feed ourselves?
Or, how can we create the condition that connect to every local communities to feed itself?
To do that, we don't look at the agricultural model of the future.
It's an old pattern.
It's all about capital, chemistry and machinery, and he's never really produced.
Instead, we look at the ecological model.
It's what's about two billion years of work.
Let's look at Miguel, to alevators like Miguel to farm and farm that's not closed in the farm that they're not closed in the factories that they're extensive to farmer, but experts in relationships, because they're the experiments, because they're the kind of experts as well.
If I have to be really better than they're chef than I've ever been.
You know, it's okay, because if that's going to be good food.
Thank you.
I grew up with a diet based on science fiction.
At high school, I've got to have an hour back and back every day.
And I was always immersed in a book, a science science science fiction, which was leading my mind in other worlds, and satisfied, in the narrative of curiosity that I had.
And that curiosity turned into the fact that every time I wasn't in the fact that every time I wasn't in school with samples, frog and snakes, snakes, insects and ties, I'd watch them at the microscope.
I was a real geek of science.
But it was always trying to figure out the world, understand the limits of possible.
And my love for science fiction actually seemed to reflect the world around me, because what was going on in, because what was going on in, in the 1960s, we were going to go to the moon, we explore the deptions of the oceans, Jacques Cousteau went into our room with his fantastic documentary documentary world that we wouldn't even imagine.
So, it seemed to reinforce my passion for science fiction.
And I was an artist.
I knew draw. I knew I had paint.
And because I didn't have this video games, nor all of these images in the middle of the media, I had to create these images in my head.
As children, as we used to read a book, we all had to, through the description of the author, put something on the screen of our heads.
And so, my answer was painting, draw creatures aliens, aliens, robots, spacecraft, all this stuff.
The lectures of mathematics were always getting shooting behind the text book.
That's because creativity had to find a way out.
And that's interesting: the Jacques Cousteau's programs me that there was a world right here.
Maybe I'd never gone into an alien world in a world.
It was very unlikely.
But that was a world where I could go really, right here on the ground, the richer and the exotic of what I'd ever imagine these books.
So, I decided that I'd be a summer at the age of 15.
And the only problem was that I lived in a small country in Canada, at 600 miles from the near ocean.
But I didn't leave me.
I brought up my father until he found an immersions of Buffalo, New York, just spent the border where we lived.
And I've been able to take the certificate in a YMCA's filled with the winter in Buffalo, New York.
And I couldn't see the ocean, the real ocean, for another two years, until I moved in California.
From then, in the last 40 years, I've spent about 3,000 hours underwater, and 500 of those hours in submersible.
And I learned that the depth of the oceans, even the deep oceans, are also rich of life that really goes beyond our imagination.
The imagination of nature is confined to our human imagination.
Again today, I'm intiming from what I see when I make the immersions.
And my story of love with the ocean continues, stronger than it's ever been.
But when I chose a career, adult, I've chosen to make film.
It seemed to be the best way to concile this smania to tell stories of creating images.
And as a kid, I was constantly comics and so forth.
So film was the only way to put together images and stories.
It was going back.
And of course, the stories I've chosen to tell were stories of science fiction: "Termintator," and "The Abyss."
And with "The Abyss," I've joined my love for the depth and immersions of a film.
So, I've got the two passions.
From "The Abyss came out of something interesting that was to solve a specific problem of the narrative in that film, which is to create that sort of liquid water creature.
And so it's born the first character and the computer that had ever seen in a film.
And even though the film doesn't make a lot of money, I've been paid, I've been tremendous of something, all the audience was hypnews.
You know, it's the law of Arthur Clarke for which every technology has advanced is indistinguished by the magic.
They were seeing something magic.
And this very excited me.
And I thought, "Fantastic, this is something that has to be adopted in the Chinese art art art."
So, with "Earth" my next film, my next film, we've gone.
Laving with the Industrial Light and Magic, we've created the guy's metal of liquid in that movie.
And it worked. And we've created a magic.
And we got the same results with a public.
But we made a little bit more with that film.
So, by tracking a line between these two points of experience, I came to the conclusion that this would have been a whole new world, it was all new world of creativity for artists.
So, I've put in a company with Stan Winston, my friend Stan Winston, my friend Stan Winston, which was the main trick and designer at that time, and we've called Digal Domain.
And the principle of society was leaving the past, the analogical processes and so forth, and go directly to the digital production.
And so we did and gave us a competitive advantage for a while.
But we're back to half the '90s in the part of creatures and characters, which is what we had to founded the society.
So, I've writing this ten called "" ""'s "" Avatar's's "Avatar" with the computer and the whole world.
And that's been returned to the mittent.
The companies have told me that we wouldn't be able to do it for a little bit.
So, I switch it and I made this film of a big ship.
I've thwaste there as a "Romeo and Juliet on on a ship."
It would be a story of epic love, a passional film.
See, of course, what I wanted to do was immergerms to see the relity of "Titanic."
That's why I did that film.
And it's the truth. I did not know.
But let's convince them. I said, "We're going to go to the relity.
We're going to use it for the beginning of the film.
It's going to be very important. It's going to be a great marketing. "
And I convinced them to funding a expedition.
It looks like crazy. But this takes us back to the imagination that creates reality.
Because we've actually created a reality and six months later I've found on a two miles and a half mighty of depth in Northern Atlantic, looking at the real Titanic, not in a film, not in a film, not in a film, not in a film, not in a film, not in a movie, not in the film, but to really.
I've been staged.
And it took a lot of preparation, we had to build movie and lights and lots of other things.
But I've stayed out of the deep, it was like a space.
Where all of it was highly technical and require huge planning.
You put you in this capsule, go down in this dark environment where you don't hope that there's no hope to be saved, you can't go back.
And I thought, "Fantastic. It's like living in a science science fiction.
It's really great. "
And so, I've been affected by the depth of the ocean exploration.
Sure, curiosity, the scientific component.
It was all. It was all.
It was curiosity. It was imagination.
And it was an experience that Hollywood could not offer me.
Of course, I could imagine a creature effect and create a visual effect. But I couldn't imagine what I saw out of the hbling.
In our latest expeditions, I've seen creatures with hydrothermal and, sometimes things I'd never seen before, things that no one had ever seen before, which were actually not even given by science to the time in which we've seen.
So I was all taken from this, and I had to do more.
So I took a curious decision.
After the success of "Titanic." I said, "OK, I'm going to go from Hollywood, and I do the explorer."
So, we started to planning these expeditions.
We found ourselves to go to the Bismark and explore it with robots.
We've come back to the Titanic.
We took little robots that we've created with the optics.
And the idea was to go inside and make a nickles inside of the ship, which had never been done.
No one had ever looked at the recruit. They didn't have the tools to do it, so we've created technology to do it.
So here I am on the Titanic, sitting in a submersible, looking at the asses that seemed like this, where I knew they seemed like this, where I knew they played the violinists.
And I'm driving a small vehicle through the corridors.
When I tell it, I'm driving it, but my mind is in the vehicle.
It seemed to be physically in the relity of the Titanic.
And it's the most surreal experience that I've ever lived, because before I knew what would be behind the corner, I knew what would have been behind, first that the lights of the vehicle it, because I'd run the film.
And the set was based on a replica of the ship of the ship model.
So it was an absolutely extraordinary experience.
And it really really made me to realize that in the experience of telepresence that you can experience through these avatar robots, the mind is injected in the vehicle, in this other form of existence.
It was really very profound.
And it might be a little bit of what's going to happen between some decade when we're starting to have cyborg to the explorations or the other reasons in some kind of the future that I'm going to be.
So, we've done these expeditions, and really started to appreciate what was there under, as the depth of the ocean where these were in the world.
Basically, they're aliens right here on Earth.
They live in a chemical environment.
They don't survive in a system based on the sun as we do.
So, you're seeing animals that live close to 500 degrees to 500 degrees centigrade.
It seems even impossible that exists.
At the same time, I was really interested in the space, again, again, it's the influence of science fiction, as a kid.
And I ended up in the space environment, really involved with the NASA, seduced in the consultant of NASA, to the consultants of the NASA,'s planning to the international biomed-cosmonauty, and all of these things, to fly to fly the international cameras with our 3D station.
It was fascinating.
But what I've finished to do was bring space scientists with us in the way.
And to bring them down because they could have access -- astrobiologists, scientists, people who's interested in these extreme environments, bringing them down and allow them to see, taking samples and so forth.
So we were documentary documentes, but we actually did science, space.
I had closed the ring between being fan of science fiction, as a kid, to do those things really.
And you know, I've learned a lot.
I learned a lot of science. But I've learned a lot about leadership.
They all think that a regist should be a leader, the capital of the ship, or something like that.
I didn't know about leadership before they're doing all these expeditions.
Why at some point I had to say, "What am I doing here?
Why am I doing this? What do I get? "
You don't make all of these show.
Let's go to pari. There's no famous.
People think it's gone between "Titanic" and "Avatar" and "Avatar's" and "I've got" Titanic "and" Avatar's "and" Avatar "and" Avatar's "Titanic's" and "
I've done all these film, all these documents for a limited audience so limited.
No famous, no glory, no money. What am I doing?
I'm doing it for the task in itself, and the ocean is the greatest challenge is the largest challenge that exists, for the ride of the discovery, and for that strange connecting when a small group of people form a very compact team.
Because we did all 10-12 people, working together for years.
Sometimes in the sea for 2-year-old.
And in that lead, you realize what's important is that it's the important is that they have for you, when you've finished a task that you can't explain anybody else.
When you go back to the ground and explains, "We had to do this, and the fibers, and the attention, and that's attention, and that's all the technology, and the complete, the aspects of human perfoot when you're working in the sea -- you can't explain. It's what they're just going to explain it.
Being a connection, create a connection of respect.
When I came back to make my next film, and that's "I've tried to apply the same principle of leadership.
It's really changed the dynamics.
And so there I'd even once again with a little group, in the inexploring "Avatar" with new new technologies that didn't exist before.
That's exciting.
It's very challenging.
And we've become a family, in the arc of four and a half years.
And it completely changed the way of my film.
People's realized that I took the organisms from the ocean and I put them on the planet Pandora.
For me, it was the essence of doing business, the process itself, which had changed.
What can we then then then?
What are the lessons we've learned?
I think the first is curiosity.
It's the most powerful thing.
The imagination is a force that can actually manifest.
And the respect of the group is more important than all around the world.
Researnings come from me and say, "Dama few advice to do this."
And I say, "Don't get limit.
Other people will do it for you, you don't make it alone, you don't know.
And the risks. "
The NASA is always saying, "the mistake is not contemplated."
But the mistake has to be an option in the art and exploration, because it's like a room in the empty.
And there's an important attempt was done without risks.
You need to be willing to those risks.
This is the thought that I want to leave you, which is that in whatever you do, the mistake is an option, but not. Thank you.
If I wanted to give you a big idea of it would be that the set of the data that we use is bigger than the sum of its parts, and that, instead of thinking about the much information, I'd like to think about how to use information to make new relationships so that we can see new trend, otherwise invisible.
So here you're seeing the typical mortality statistics.
This tool that I use is a little experiment.
It's called Pivot, and with Pivot, I can choose to filter one cause of death, let's say, accidents.
And they're going to see new relationships.
The reason is that here in the central part, people are more active, and they're more fragile.
We can take a step back and reorganize data because of death, let's see that circumstances and cancer are the cheap, but not for everybody.
If we're going forward and let's say under the 40, let's see that accidents are the cause of death I worry more.
It's closer, it's important for men.
So you'll have understood that visualize information and data, it's a little bit like swimming in a sea of information.
And if we can do this with data, because we can't even do it with content?
For example, we have the cover of every Sports Illustrated.
That's it. Everything.
You can get into your rooms and try.
With Pivot you can see a decade.
Or a specific year.
You can issue a particular number.
For example, let's take the athletes like this number, their sports.
I'm a fan of Lance Armstrong, so click here and I see all the numbers in which Lance Armstrong.
Now, if I want to give us a look at this, I could think, why don't give a look at all the cycle? "
I take a step back and the visual.
And now I see Greg Lemond.
You'll have understood that when you navigate in this information, and it's not just a research, it's not just a research, it's not just a research, it's not just the browser.
But you do something slightly different.
It's a half that we're going to change how we can use information.
Let's still this idea that can look a little bit crazy.
We've taken every single page of Wikipedia and we reduced it to a brief that's in a little synosse and an icona that's the area.
I'll just show you the first 500 in Wikipedia.
Even in this screen, we can do a lot.
You understood what areas are the most visited about Wikipedia.
It's this selecting government.
We've got this option we see that Wikipedia more often associated with this voice are the "Personages of Time Magazine."
That's meaningful because it's emerge.
And you're seeing it's a step back to see this together.
If I take one of these sums I can then zooming on category, "Time Magazine's Time Magazine.
and see them.
At this point I'll see that the majority from some of the world of science. A minor number of affairs.
Here's my boss.
One is from music.
And it's pretty interesting, Bono has also won a TED.
So we're going to see all the winners of TED.
For the first time we're really shifting as if it was a network, not from the page, but at a level of abstraction.
I want to show you another thing that might surprise you.
This is the New York Times.
Pivot, this application -- we don't call browser, because it's not a browser, but we need to see web -- we add this technology for zoom in the web, like this.
I can take a step back and go back to a specific section. That's important because it's just to see the Web pages so let me see my whole navigation in the Internet itself.
I can zooming on what I did in specific moments.
In fact, you can see the state of the demo that I just presented.
I can see some other things I've seen in the day.
If I'm going to take a step back and see all I can do at the pieces of my historical, or my research.
Here I was looking at the Bing engine, I was looking for Live Labs here for Live Labs Pivot.
And from here, I can zoom in on my web, and just just launch from here.
It's a lot of times times, and in every case it's bigger than the sum of the parts, the data.
In the world, the data is seen as a kind of malbuilding.
It's about information.
It's about the data.
What if we put down down above if we put the web on the other, we'd go from one thing to something to the other, we'd used to go from a lot of things to be able to see those structures that otherwiring would be born?
And then instead of being trapped into the data, we could really extract information.
Instead of all of the information, we can pull out of knowledge.
And by knowledge, maybe it's also the wisdom.
And with that thank you.
This is all the time they're talking about happiness.
I asked to count the number of books that the word "happiness" happiness and published in the last five years, they stopped counted after they've reached to 40, and there were a lot more.
There's a huge wave of interest on happiness, some researchers.
There's a lot of coaching happiness.
Everybody would want to make more happy people.
But despite all this flow of work, there's a series of cognitive trap, which somehow impossible impossible to elaborate ideas about happiness.
My talk is going to be more importantly these "cognitive traps."
And it's about profit's about their happiness, and it's about the study that we're confused as everybody else.
The first of these traps is the rewitance to admit the complexity.
It turns out that the word happiness isn't a better word "it's a useful word for too much.
And I think that's going to take a particular meaning, but in massive line, we're going to have to tell us about this acceptions and we're going to have to adopt the most complicated vision of what "well-being."
The second trap is the confusion between experience and memory: it's basically to choose between being happy in life and be happy about their lives.
And these are two extremely different concept, both part of the concept of happiness.
And the third one is the illusion of focus that is the unfortunate that we can't think that we can't think of some circumstances the importance.
I mean, it's a real cognitive trap.
and there's no way to do the right thing.
I'd like to start with an example of a person who, after a session of questions and answers, after my lesson, telling a story.
[Disse] Disse while listening to an absolutely magnificent music.
And then he added in a lot of emotional, who had ruined the whole experience.
But that was not true.
What it was red was the memory of the experience.
He had lived the experience.
And he'd heard for 20 minutes of music.
but it wasn't counted for nothing because he's reminded with a certain memory; The reminder was ruined, and the memory of what was left.
What this episode tells us, in the bottom, is that we could think of ourselves and other people in terms of two. "It's."
There's a lot of experiences, which lives in the present and knows the present, and it's capable of relive the past, but that it's just the present.
It's the self self that lives lives in the experiences, "and what the doctor is coming -- you know when the doctor ask," Ti's bad now, when the doctor asking, "Do it's all the time here?"
And then there's the self self that's called "that's itself, it's about" that's signs, and it's that's where the doctor gets in asking, "How are you heard in the last time?"
or something like that.
Those are two differently, the self that's living an experience and what if they're memories and confusion between the two is part of the confusion of happiness.
The self is that memories, it's a singer.
And this process begins with a fundamental response of our memories -- started immediately.
We don't tell stories when we decide to tell them.
Our memory tells us stories, which is, what's remains of our experiences is a story.
Let me start with an example.
It's an old study.
It takes the experiences of two patients during a painful procedure.
I wouldn't guess in details. It's not even painful today, but it was painful when this study was conducted in the '90s.
You asked the patients to bring their pain every 60 seconds.
And here's the results for two patients.
Those are the results.
If you ask, "Who two suffered more?"
It's a very simple question.
Yeah, the Patient B has suffered.
his colonal coloned more and for every minute of pain of pain, A patient's suffered from the patient's patient's suffered from the patient's patient.
But now there's another question, "How about these patients think they're suffering?"
And here's the surprise: That's Patient had a memory of the colonscope of the Patient B.
The colonful stories were different because one of the specifically delicate part of the procedure is the way -- no one of those stories is particularly -- but one of the two is particularly worse -- but one of the two is particularly worse -- one of the two is particularly worse.
And the worst is that where the pain was massive in the final moment.
It's a negative story.
How do I know it?
Because we asked these people after the colonscope, and even at the time distance of time, "How bad was the experience, all considered?"
and it turns out that it's worse for B, in the memories.
So it's a direct conflict between the sone that's living experiences and the site that reminds them.
On the site's point of view that lives, it's clear that B has suffered most.
So, what you could do for the patient A, and we've done clinical experiments, and it's been actually done, and it works, you could extend the tube without going too.
That's going to cause a pain in in the patient, but only a little bit, and less than before.
And by doing this for a couple minutes, the sis that live the experience of the Patient's experience. It's going to be worth better, because now the Patient A's now the Patient has a better memory of his experience.
How do you call a story?
And that's true of the stories that are from the reminds that for the stories that we invent. That defines a story, are the significant changes and the final moments.
The final is very, very important and, in this case, the final dominated.
So, the smooth that lives lives in a long way.
It's been experiences that's what happens to these moments?
And the answer is simple.
They're forever always saying that most part of our life -- as I've calculated -- as I've calculated -- as I've calculated -- I've got about 600 million. In a month, if they're count.
Most of them are completely ignored.
And yet, in some way you have the feeling that they should count, that what happens in these moments of experience is our life.
These are the limited resources that we're spending as we're in this world.
And as a spends it, it would seem to be relevant, but it's not the story that it reminds for us.
So we have a site that reminds and a sis that live experiences that are quite different.
The largest difference between the two is like treating time.
On the site's point of view that lives lives, if you're in vacation, and the second weeks is funny as the first, then the vacation of two weeks is a week.
But this isn't absolutely the way it works.
That's why it's a number of two weeks is actually better than a week of vacation, because there's no new memories.
You didn't change the story.
And in this way, the time is the variable of critical variable that's reminds that's remembers.
The time has a limited impact on this story.
Well, the feeling that experiences makes more than remind and tell stories.
It's actually the self self that make decisions because, if we consider a patient who's had, for example, two different medical colonscope with two different physicians, and he's going to be chosen less "" negative, "and that's going to be chosen.
The sets that live experiences doesn't have voice in those choices.
In fact, we don't choose between experiences, but between the memories of those experiences.
And even when we think about our future, we don't think about our future as experiences.
So let's think of our future as a memories.
You can basically look at this situation, like a sanny of the site that reminds, and you can think of the site that reminds, and you can think of the site that's living experiences, it doesn't have to be experiences, it doesn't need.
I've got the feeling that when we're going to often, the case that's vacance to the service of our site that reminds.
And this is a little bit hard to justify.
That's how much's consuming our memories?
This is one of the explanations that's given for the predominance of the site.
When I think of that, I'm in my mind is in the Antarctica of a few years ago, which is one of the best vacances of my life, and where I think relatively.
And I'm probably going to think of that journey of three weeks, to say, 25 minutes in the last four years.
If I've ever opened the 600 photographs of the journey, I'd spent another now. It's three weeks of travel that translates in massive. It's like there's a argument.
Well, I could be a little bit extremely, in my waste for the consumption of reminds, but even if you do more than this, a question genuine is pone.
Why are we weight to the memory of the weight that we make experiences?
I want you to think of an experiment with thinking.
Imagine that in the next vacances that at the end of the vacances, all of the photographs will be destroyed, and you're going to take a medicine for your love, so you wouldn't remember anything.
Should you choose the same vacance? What if you could choose a different vacance, it creates a conflict between the two, and you have to think of how to solve that conflict and actually isn't so obvious because, if you think in terms of time in terms of time, then you're going to have an answer.
And if you think in terms of memories, you might get another answer.
Because we choose the vacations we do, it's a problem that's a problem that puts us in front of the two.
The two is slate two notion of happy.
There's actually two concepts of happy concepts that we can use, one for each site.
So you can ask, what's happy is that it makes the experience?
And then you can ask: How happy are the moments in the lifetime of the site that lives lives?
And it's about -- happiness for times, it's a complicated process.
What are the emotions we can measure?
And by the way, now we're able to do a good idea of happiness of the site that lives lives in time.
If you ask the site of the site that remembers, it's a completely different thing.
It's not how long it's alive.
It's about how much it's the person when you think about his life.
It's a very different idea.
Anyone is not able to distinguish these two notions, will not do anything else that's going to make confusion, "in studies about happiness, and I bought to a group of students of well-being, who have gone on happiness for a long time in this way.
The difference between the site of the sis that live the experiences and satisfaction of the satisfaction that memories has been recognized in the last years, and they're now in the effort to measure the two separately, the Gallup to a world where more than half a million people have been stage to one on what they think about their lives and their experiences.
And there were other studies in this direction.
So in the last few years, we started to learn about the happiness of two.
And the largest lesson we've learned, is that are very different.
You could know how much one person is satisfied with their life, and yet this doesn't tell you about how much happily they're going to tell you much about how happy they're living their life and vice.
To give you an idea of correlation, the correlation is about 0.5..
which means that if I met someone, and tell you, "oh, his father and" oh, "Oh," how much would you know? "
Well, you would know something about his height, but with a lot of uncertainty.
You'd always have a little bit of uncertainty.
If I tell you that someone thinks his life is at the level eight in a scale from one to a ten, you're going to be very, you're going to be a lot of people who live experiences.
So correlation is low.
We've got a certain knowledge of what controls is happy.
We know that money is very important, the goals are very important.
We know that being happy means to be satifacts with people who like us, transport of time with the people who like us.
There's pleasures, but these are the main ones.
So if you want to maximize the happiness of two, you'll end up doing very different things.
The conclusion of what I've said right now is that we don't think of happiness.
This is completely different.
In more, very quickly, another reason that we can't think in a linear way of happiness is that we don't pay attention to the same things when we think about life, and when we live life.
So, if you do the simple question of how happy people in California, you wouldn't get the answer correct.
When you ask this question, you think you should be happily happily in California, that in Ohio.
What happens is that when you think about life in California, you're thinking about the contest between California and other places, and for example is about the climate.
Well, it turns out that climate isn't so much as important for the self that's living in the experiences and it's not very important for the seven is that reflects as happy.
But since the seven is that reflected is in charge, you might end -- some people could, at the end, transfer in California.
And it's interesting verify what's going to happen to be happily happy.
Well, the sone that's living experiences won't become happy.
We know it.
But one thing is going to happen.
And they're going to think they took the right decision.
It's very difficult to think of well-being, and I think I gave you the idea of how difficult it is.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have a question for you.
Thank you very much.
When we were at the telephone a couple of weeks ago, I've mentioned to me that an interesting outcome from the Gallup.
It's something that thinks we've still a few minute?
Daniel Kaheman: Yeah.
I think the thing that we've found that we've found in the Gallup is a number that we didn't expect to find.
We've found that, with reference to the sm living experiences.
When we've observed as feelings, we've found that, we've found that, under an income of 60,000 dollars a year, for the Americans, on a very large sample of about 600,000 U.S. Americans, it's a sample of 600,000 dollars a year --
CA: 60,000 DK: 60,000 dollars a year; 60,000 dollars a year, people are infelected, and they become progressively more than the poor, to go.
I mean, I've seen the lines.
clearly, what's happening is that the money doesn't buy happiness of the experience, but the lack of money certainly, and we can measure that very, very, very clearly.
In terms of the other is, the site that reminds, is all another story.
It's more money, you're.
It's not about emotions.
CA: But Danny, all the American effort about life, freedom, freedom, the search of happiness.
If people take seriously this discovery, practical discovery, which is what we've believed, for instance, politics on the pocket and so on.
There's a chance that politicians, and the nation in general, can take a discovery like that seriously and bring a public policy based on it?
DK: You know I think you recognize the role of happiness in public politics.
The present of consideration will be slows in the United States, there's no doubt, but in the U.K., it's become reality, and in others.
People are starting to recognize that they should think about happiness when they think about public politics.
It's going to be a little bit and people are going to talk about if they want to study the experience of happiness or if they want to study the value of life that we need to start this debate to be.
As you're going to grow the happy directions of how you think, and in the second of how you think, and in the second that you're thinking, and depends that makes experiences.
All of this is going to influence the politics, I think, in the years they're going to be.
In the United States, they're doing effort to measure the experience of population.
And this, I think, it's going to go into the next decade, maybe maybe two, of the national statistics.
CA: Well, it seems to me that's going to be, or not supposed to be, the question of more interesting politics to follow in the next few years.
Thank you very much for making invented the behavioral economics.
Thank you Danny Kaheman.
I'm going to talk about energy and climate.
It can look strange, because I've seen that in my work at the foundation of vaccines and seeds, things to invent and give the world to help the two billion poorest people to live lives better.
But climate and energy, actually, in fact, they're extremely important to these people, they're more important to them for anyone else in the world.
It's a worst climate means, for many years.
It's too many rain, or too little.
The things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can't support.
because it's hunger. It's conflict.
Climbs, they're going to be for them terrible.
Even the cost of energy is, for them, important.
In fact, if you could put the price of one thing, to reduce poverty, you'd pick up poverty, you'd pick up the energy.
The price of the energy price over time.
And it's a civilization of energy progress in the energy fields.
The coal revolution has food that industrial.
And even in the 20th century, we've had a rapid decline in the price of electricity, which explains why we have refrigerator, we can create modern materials and do so many things.
In the rich world, so we're about electricity in an excellent situation in an excellent situation.
But as the price scenes, for example of the half, we have to respect a new wind, the constitution of CO2 emissions.
CO2 is heating the planet, and its equation is very simple.
There's a temperature temperature of temperature, which induces very negative.
It's about climate and, maybe even worse, even worse, indeed, in the sense that the natural ecosystems can't look at these quickly changes and so they collapse.
The evaluation of what the temperature is because of a given increase in CO2, and as each of the two worst things, the other, it's uncertainly, but not.
And there's certainly uncertainty about what negative effects, but they're going to be negative.
It's about, I've often asked the best scientists: Do we have to reduce emissions?
We can't only reduce them half or a fourth?
And the answer is that, until we don't go down to zero, the temperature will continue to go.
It's a big challenge, so.
It's not like to say, "Let's get a 3.5 feet under a bridge."
It's not going up a little bit. "
It's got to go down to zero.
Now, we make a lot of CO2 every year, over 26 billion tons.
About 20 tons for every American.
For the inhabitants of poor countries, it's less of a poor.
The world's media is about five tons per capita.
And somehow, we need to do progress that zero.
The emissions are constantly increased.
Only some economic changes have changed this tendency, so we've changed this tendency, so we've got to fast down to zero.
This equation has four factors.
It's a series of multiply.
We have a lot of the left, the CO2, and the factors on the right, and the factors on the right are the population, the services that on the right is the population, the average of each person use, the services and the CO2 eman of energy.
Let's look at each factor and see how we can get it.
It's probably one of these numbers have to go down to almost zero.
It's high school.
Let's see a little bit.
The first factor is the population.
The world today's 6.8 billion people.
We go to the nine billion.
If we make a good job with new vaccines, healthcare, we can reproductive health, we can go down the maybe 10, 15 percent, but here's 10, 15 percent, but here's the increase of about 30 percent.
The second factor are the services we use.
Which understood all, the food we eat, TV, the TV, the heat, the heat.
They're things desirable, and free of poverty, it means to provide these services for almost all the world.
And it's a positive thing that's.
In the rich world, in the richest billion, we could probably save and use less, but in media, every year, this number will go.
And so, complex services, the amount of services that you're going to be more than twice.
This is a very simple example of service.
You know, you've got the illumination in your house, but these kids didn't, so they except and read their tasks in the streets.
The efficiency -- and, the energy for unit's energy for unit -- here finally, there's good news.
This factor is not increasing.
Thank you very much, new ways of illuminate, new ways of illuminate, highly constructions that are made differently, for many of the services that can be considerable energy consumed.
In some services, you can reduce 90 percent.
There's some other services, like fertilizers, or the airplane, where the margin of improving are very, very, very inferior.
So, absolutely, in the best of cases, the energy consumption is going to reduce them from three to maybe six times.
But these first three factors are reducing emissions from 26 to the best cases, maybe 13 billion tons.
It's not enough.
Let's look at the fourth factor, the key amount of CO2 emit for units of energy.
The question is, can we reduce the zero?
If you burn coal, no.
If you burn natural gas, no.
Almost all the ways to make electricity today, part of the renewables and nuclear, CO2.
What we're going to have to do on a global scale.
And we need to say, "miracles."
It's called "miracle," I don't mean something impossible.
The microprocessor is a miracle. The personal computer is a miracle.
The Internet, and its services, they're a miracle.
People today here today have been in the creation of many miracles.
We don't normally have a scade, a date within which we're releasing the miracle.
Usually, it's the window and something happens, something else's not.
In this case, we've got to lead to all speed, and make a miracle in the time.
I asked myself, how to illustrate this concept?
Is there some natural example, some demonstration that capture capture the imagination of people?
I've got a year ago, when you take the mosquitos, and people found it.
They're part of the fact that, in the world, there are people living with mosquitos.
This is my idea for energy.
I've decided that we're going to be this year my contribution.
Here's the lights here.
They're saying they don't even get out of the box.
... now, we can invest tricks like this, but they're not going to be help.
There's a solution or so much that they're working on big scale and very reliable, and though they're exploring in many directions, I think that only five few important effects.
I have expect the mareas, the geoterm, nuclear fusion, the nuclear fusion.
They could also give some contribution, and if they can do more than I look, but here I'm interested in, but here I'm interested in that we're going to have to work on each of those five, and not give up to any of these five, and they can't give up a lot of difficult challenges.
Let's look at the first fuels of fossil fuels, coal or natural gas.
Here's what's looks simple, but it's not, and it's captured the CO2, after the combuston, at the bottom, present it to some part, and hope that's left.
Today, there's experimental technologies that captured 60 -- 80 percent of CO2, but they're going to be very complicated and it's going to be very complicated, and it's going to be able to agree about where this CO2.
The spinous issue is still the long time.
Who will trust you?
Who guaranteed something that's literally billions of times more volume than all sorts of imaginable, like nuclear or else?
It's a huge volume.
So it's a difficult problem.
Another is the nuclear would be the nuclear.
But the nuclear presents three big problems.
The cost, especially in the very regulate countries, it's high.
The question of security, the security feeling that nothing can go wrong, sick the employment of human workers, and that the lovely doesn't be used to do beautiful.
And how then run the scories?
The amount of laughing, worries are many.
People need to be embedded.
So you're very difficult problems, so that we could solve, and what we should work.
The last three of the five sources of them.
They're the people often called "renewable."
And that's the big advantage of not to require a combustible, present some disadvantages.
The first is that the energy density produced with these technologies is clearly inferior to that one of an electric central central.
It's going to collect energy, and so many squares, and so many squares, of thousands of times more estese than a normal electric central.
Also, these sources are intermittent.
The sun doesn't have all day, nor every day, and the wind is always suffering.
And so, if you're depends on these sources, you need to find a way of electrical energy even when the source doesn't produce.
It's facing us on the front of the cost.
And the distribution.
For example, let's say that this source source is in the sumption.
So you don't just need the technology, but you're also going to connect with the risks of apply.
And finally, the accumulation problem.
To estimate the size of the problem, I've analyzed all sorts of bacterial, computers, telephones, from any, I've compared to the amount of electrical energy used in the world and I found that all the bacterial energy.
So we've got a big step forward, an improvement of 100 times as we're going.
That's not impossible, but it's not very simple.
This problem is already manifest when the sources "intermittent," produce more than, 20 to 30 percent of the energy consumed.
If you go down to those sources for 100 percent, you need a battery. "
But how are we going on on on this street? What is the right approach?
Is it a Manhattan? What could this solve the problem?
A lot of companies, hundreds, they have to get to work.
We need at least percent people in each of these five sectors.
Most of them, look at them, you'd say, you'd like.
And I think that here, in the TED group, a lot of people are already working in these fields.
Bill Gross has different companies, including a called eSolar that vant big technologies in the thermical solar technology.
Vinod Khosla is investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting pots, and I'm giving my support to this.
Nathan Myhrvold and I are funding a company that, it's going to go and follow the way of the nuclear.
There's some innovations in the range, the nuclear liquid nuclear.
But from a lot of time, the sector is stop, that there's a few good ideas that's where there's no surprising.
The idea of Terrapower is that, instead of burning only part of the uranium, the U235, the one percent of the uranio, we've decided to burn the U238, 99 percent. It's a crazy idea, in a way.
To the truth if it's a lot of time, but it's never been proved if it would work or no, you can do a simulation and see that yes, you can do a simulation and see that yes, with the right materials, it's going to work.
And because it's 99 percent of the uranium, the structure of the costs similar.
You're burning the scories, and they're using the scories of today, which become, from the problem that they're, the problem that were, a exploiting resources.
It's consumption the uranium. It's a kind of candela.
It's like a straightforce of wood. It's called the wave of progressive.
On the point of fuel, the problem is solved.
Here's a picture of a place in Kentucky.
That's the 99 percent uranium, 99 percent uranium, which has been taken as well as well as well as well as well as well as well, and so it's called impoverished.
These are going to be energy to the United States for centuries.
And by showing the sea water, with an economic process, there would be enough fuel for the rest of the life of this planet.
So a lot of challenges tend to us, but this is an example of hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to progress.
How should we measure our progress?
What should be the pages?
Let's refer the goal, and then we've got the intermeds.
You've heard a lot of people talking about an 80 percent reduction for 2050, it's really important to do.
20 percent will be produced by poor countries, and from a little bit of agriculture.
At that point, we're going to be solved the deforestation and production.
To get 80 percent, so the developed countries like China, including countries like China, they're going to have to replace their electrical production.
The other question is, we're doing this technology to zero emissions?
We put it in practice in developed countries?
Are we spread high?
It's a very important thing.
It's a key.
And if you're going to look at the page of 2020?
That should have the same two aspects.
We'd have to implements to start to get reductions.
Let's be the minor, it's going to be the total amount of CO2, and so the temperature.
But the vote in this material, doing things that don't make great reductions, it's just a weight parallel, or even slightly inferior, at the least, that's the speed of the innovation of new inventions.
We need to push these progress, and we can measure the speed from the number of companies, and we can measure the speed from the number of companies,
Very great books have been written about.
The book of Al Gore, "Pchoice," and David McKay, "" Hot Air. "
These books learn the problem and create a context in which they create a context in which they need the debate, because these things need to be needed to the spread.
There's a lot of things to have to happen.
So I have a wish, I have a wish.
It's a very concrete that we're going to invent technology.
If I had to choose one wish for the next 50 years, to be able to choose the president of the country, the manufacturing of a vaccine, which I'm doing a vaccine, or I would choose this last.
It would be the greater impact.
If this wish wouldn't be done, the fruit between who thinks and the long-term, between the United States and China, between poor and rich, rich, will be terrible, and more importantly, the life of those two billion people will be much worse.
So what do we need to do?
So what's I'm inviting you to take the initiative and get?
It's necessary a lot of research.
When nations come together in places like Copenhagen, they weren't just talk about CO2.
They'd have to argue the program of innovations, and you're going to be able to invest in these innovative approaches.
We need incentives, taxes on CO2, the "cap and trade" tools that clear the cost of pollution.
We need to spread the message.
We need to make this more rational dialogue, and it needs to include the government choices.
It's a commitment, but I think.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Only for knowing more about Earth, that's...
first of all, can you give us an idea of the size of the investments?
Bill Gates: Realizing the software, get the supercomputer, assuming all the great scientists, what we've done, requires just tens of millions, and even when we're tested only in a Russian reactor, to be safely, we're going to have to talk, we're going to talk only about hundreds of millions.
It's a hard thing to build the pilot, and finding several billion, the authority, the place where it's going to be built the first examples.
Once built the first, if it works as announced, it's going to be the egger of Colombo, because the cost of generated energy, they're completely different from nuclear today.
CA: So if I understand well, this implica the construction, well underground, of a construction, well-underground, of a nuclear massive nuclear fuels, of this kind of unuranium.
Then the process begins from the top and progress?
BG: Right. The reactors, today, they're restricted to continue, many people, many controls that can't work, open continue, things that enter and except,
It's not good.
If it's very cheap is very cheap and you can make it for 60 years, put all of the complexity.
It's in there, it's a lot of years, and then you end up.
CA: A nuclear plant of itself!
BG: Yeah. Well, the waste can leave there, and then you can take them in another reactor and burn them.
And we're going to begin with existing, we're now conserved in vass of cooling or containers.
They'll be our first fuel.
So what it was a problem of conventional reactors will be the fuel of our, and the volume of reactors, and the reflew will reduce, not just this process.
CA: But when you're talking around the world's potential of this technology, where most interest in its achieving?
BG: Well, there's no place in particular, and there's all these interesting rules of transparency on everything that's defined nuclear, so we're making a lot of interest.
Our staff was in Russia, India, China.
I just met the Sgretary for Energy.
We've talked about how this idea looks at the current program.
I'm optimist. Frances have done in this work in this field.
It's a variation on something that's already been done.
It's an essentially improvement, but it's a fast reactor, that many countries have already built, so anyone who's already built a good reactor.
CA: What are the time and the probability that's time and the probability that something like that?
BG: Well, for one of these large-scale projects, that produces energy, which produces doesn't cost a lot, we're talking about 20 years to build it.
That's the except that the environmental models are demonstrates.
And that's okay, that's not very little, that's a question.
And now they've now, fortunately, dozens of companies in the sector, that's what they're going to work, if they're going to be upon.
And it's better if a lot of solutions will happen, because at that point you're going to be able to remember a set of solutions.
It's necessary that at least a success.
CA: By talking about important innovations, revolutionary innovations, revolutionier, this is the largest that you know?
BG: A revolution is the most important thing.
It would be also without the environmental winners, but the environmental winners make it really much more important.
It's where we have other innovators.
We don't know their job like this, but a nuclear is the nuclear "modular, a different approach.
There's a liquid reactor. It seems hard to do, but maybe they say the same thing of us.
So there's different, but it's the cooking molecules a million times more energy than a million times more energy of a molecule, let's say, coal aspects, the potential waste, the potential, in terms of effectively on the environment and other, it's nearly one class.
CA: And if it doesn't work?
Does we shouldn't we be able to go to emergency room temperature?
BG: If you're in that situation, it's a little bit like when you eat too, and you're going to have a heart attack.
Where do you take that point? You could need a surgeon or something similar.
There's a research line on the geoengineering called geoengineering, which are various techniques that slowing down the action.
It's like cleaning a polar.
I hope you don't need it.
Some people say they wouldn't even work on the police, because you might be going to continue to eat because the surgeon will go.
I don't think it's a mark choice, view the importance of the problem, but now in the heavy of the engineering geoengineering asks us if you're going to pick solutions in the case that's happening.
CA: Clima-skeptical: if I had a phrase or two from their dir, like persuade persuade that they've gone?
BG: Well, unfortunately, there's different kinds of skeptical and the science topics are very few.
Some people say that there's a negative feedback to the clouds of warming.
They're very, very, very few things that's just to say that there's a million. Here's the main problem looks like in AIDS.
There's a error now and pay the consequences just a lot later.
And so when you're in a thousand emergency, the idea of making sacrifice you're just after --
It's not well notes.
In fact, the IPP.C.'s not necessarily the worst case; there's people in the rich world that look at IPPC and says:'s not eventually.
The fact is that the uncertainty should pushing us on action.
But my dream is that, if I'm going to do it economic, and to respect the winners on the CO2, then they're going to tell me, I wouldn't care if I don't emit, but I'll accepted because it's cheap because it's more economic technologies.
CA: Is this going to be the answer to the Bjorn Lomborg, that if you invest all of your energy, and trying to solve the CO2, your other targets, will sacrifice, are they going to be sacrifice, when there's better, when there's the best to do, it means to fit resources?
BG: Well, the effect in research and development --
So let's say that the United States should spend 10 billion as more than how much they do now.
It shouldn't have to distrate resources.
The things that make a lot of money, and they're also reasoning, they're thinking, they're financial solutions.
It's to me, it's the waste.
Unless you're not funding the curve of learning, getting closer to the point where they're going to be very cheap, I think that the effort will be very cheap.
If the alternative is: "Let's make the expensive energy, so that only the rich energy can afford, all the present, all the people can afford to pay the energy five times so much without change.
The disaster would be for those two billion.
And Lomborg has reviewed his positions.
His argument now is, "Why don't it's discussing and Svilup?"
It's for its past again, you've got to the "skeptical, but he's understood that it's a question of Research and Same.
And it's a question that I think is appropriate.
It's incredible as a little bit of research and development.
CA: Well Bill, I think I'm just thinking about a majority of the audience of the audience that I'm going to become reality. Thank you.
BG: Thank you.
I'd like to share with you a discovery that I'm writing an article for the Wired magazine.
I've always gotten the dictionary of hand every time I write something, but I'd already ended up with the article and I've done that I've never ever ever ever ever ever in my life tried the word "disaster to see what I'd found.
Let me read you the results.
"Disable", agricultural: damage, no, useless, useless, inhurt, hurt, eventually, zopping, zopinion, heaven, decreased, impoverished, impoverished, impoverished, Senile, deme, decrease, Senile, decreased out of the circulation, leaving out of the circulating and weak.
Contrarians: In shape, powerful.
I was reading this list to a very high voice to a friend, and at the beginning, it was so ridiculous, but, just just my voice went, and I had to stop to pick my voice, and I had to stop to pick me up to the shock and the impact that the asstop of these words.
You know, we're talking about, of course in my old dictionary.
I'm thinking, it's going to be an old building, right.
But, in fact, the buildings of the early 80 years.
when I was starting to the elementary schools and I was forming and learning what was out of my family and things in other children and the world around me.
and, I used to tell them, thank God, I wasn't using the dictionary of syonymous at that time.
I mean, from this explanation looks like that I've been born in a world that sees someone like me as one that has nothing good for them, when, in fact today, they're celebrated for opportunities and adventure that my life has done.
So, I'm immediately going to see on the edition 2009 in the network, waiting me to find a review without value.
This is the version of description.
Unfortunately, it's not much better.
I find the last two words underneath "particularly uncontrary" and "healthy," the whole "and" healthy. "" "" and "healthy."
is what we think of people when we see them with these words.
It's about the values behind these words, and how we build these values.
Our language influence our thinking and our vision of the world and how we see other people.
In fact, many civilization, including that Greece and Romana, believed that Greek and that Romana, they had to offending verbally was more powerful, because to say things to the high voice was there.
So what's we want to bring to exist, a person who is limited, or a person with greater force?
So, casually by doing something simple as nominating a person, a baby, we could put tapes and throw shadows on their strength.
Wouldn't we want to open doors for them?
One person, so that's open the doors, it was the doctor of "I had Duploss in Wilmington, Delaware.
His name is Dr. Pizztor.
ItaloAmericans, whenever name, apparently, was too difficult to say to a major part of the Americans, so it became Ph.P.
And the Ph.D. "they'd always had a perfect inclination to work with children.
I was practically anything of the period that I've spent in the hospital, with the exception of sessions.
I had to do what they looked infinite repelies of exercises with these big elastic fases, in different colors, you know, to help me build the muscles of legs.
And I hate these more than everything.
I would hate them, really hate them.
And, you know, I'd already know, like one of five years, with Dr. P to try to go down from these exercises, Inuse, clear.
And one day, a day, came to one of my Stanks and inexorable, these seats.
and he said, "wow, Aimee, you're a young girl so strong, I think you're going to break one of those fases.
"When I lost it, I'll give you 100 dollars."
Now, of course, it was just a little maneuver to make me exercises that I didn't want to do with the perspective when I didn't want to be the rich of the second plan.
and turn it into an interesting experience for me.
And I wonder today, the entity of his vision, and of his declaration is about me as a young girl, redefined my view of me in a strong, poderly and athletic person to the future.
This is an example of how adults with power positions can infy the force of a child.
But, in the example of the vocabulary of the vocabulary, our language's not the possibility of evolving to the reality that we'd all want to be able to see itself.
Our language was not the step of the changes of our societies, many of which have been created by technology technology.
certainly, from a doctor's standing point, my legs, laser's laser's labeling and also rich for bodies that are helping people to cooperate with their ability, and move beyond the ability that nature has imposed, without mentioning the platforms of social network, allow people to identify,
So maybe the technology is going to revealing even more clearly what's always been a truth, that each one has something rare and poderly to our society, and the human ability to adapt to our society, and the human ability to adapt us is the bigger quality.
The human ability to adapt us, is something interesting, because people have always wanted to talk to me to them.
This sentence has never gone well, and I've been very well, and I'm always heard of people to this, and I think I'm beginning to understand why.
It's underwear in this sentence, unsmilkable, it's the idea that success, or happiness, is to come from the other side of a challenge or sign of this experience, if my success in life came from a ability to a life with prosthetic, or what people feel like my disability.
However, we've changed, we're marked, logically, by a challenge, physically or mentally both.
And I would say that's a good thing.
The adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to fix our lives.
It's part of our life.
And I tend to think that it's like my shadow.
Sometimes it's a lot of the time, but it's always with me.
And, of course, I wouldn't try to decline the impact, the weight of the person's suffering.
There are the adversity and challenges in life, and it's all true and it's true and it's all real and the question is not if you're going to adversity.
So, our responsibility is not simply to protect people to us to protect people to us from adversity, but to prepare them to the right way.
And let's give our children when we hear hear that they're not ready to adapt.
There's an important and distinction between the medical fact of being a person amputated and the subjective opinion of societies that I'm seeing a disabled or not.
And, in truth, the only disability that I had to deal with is if the world has ever thought I could be described from those words.
In our desire to protect those who we love to address a cold, dying truth on their medical projectors, or, really, really, the projects of their life expectancy, we have to be secure.
Maybe the existing model to just look at what's broken in you and how to put it in the place, it can weak more the subject than the disease itself.
Don't treating a person in the complete, you don't understand its potential, we're creating another illness to natural suffering that already have.
We're actually giving a vote to the value of a person in our community.
So we've got to see through the disease of human capability.
and, much more importantly, there's a relationship between those income and our great creativity.
So, it's not about assuming, or denial, these numbers of searches like something that we want to avoid or purpose, but rather find those opportunities in a accident.
So, maybe the idea I want to explain to you is that there's no thing like to overcome an adversity, as well as you learn to use it, to use a term of fighting free, maybe even drage out of free, maybe even dance with us.
And maybe, if we look at an accident like a natural thing and useful, and we're less suspended by his presence.
This year, let's celebrate the question of Charles Darwin, and it's 150 years ago, when I write on evolution on evolution, that Darwin has illustrated, I think, the truth to the truth of the human character.
To say this, in another way, it's not the stronger than survive, and it's not even the smarter, it's not the smarter, it's not the smarter, it's not even the smarter, it's not the stronger, and it's not the stronger than the world, and it's not the stronger.
The conflict is the genesis of crazy.
From Darwin, among the other things, we can recognize that the human ability to survive and develop has led by by the suffering of human spirit through human spirit.
So again, transformation, adaptation, is our largest quality.
And perhaps, we're not going to go to evidence, we don't know what we're doing.
Maybe that's what's gives us the adversity, a sense of your force.
So we can take a gift.
We can imagine the adversity as something more than it's more difficult.
Maybe we can see it as a change.
The adversity is a change that we don't adapted to us yet.
I think the largest adversity we created is this idea of normal normal idea. Now, who is this idea of normal now?
There's a normal, there's a typical, there's a typical.
And would you want to meet those poor people?
I don't think right.
If we could change this paradigm from one of how to get the normality to a chance, or potentiality, to be even a little bit more dangerous, we can understand the force of so many children, and inviting them to bring their valuable capacity with the community.
The anthropologists teaches us that what we, as humans, we've always wanted to the members of our community is to be to help to contribute.
There's a evidence that in the Netherlands, 60,000 years ago, led to the old and the subjects with seats and the subjects with prevalence of these people were the value of the community, and the survival of these people were the value of the community: They didn't see these people like rarian and value.
A few years ago, I was in a citizens where I grew up in the northwest of Pennsylvania.
and I was planning in front of a pomodors.
It was extremely and I had trax of pants.
I've heard this guy, his voice behind me saying, "but it's not Aimee Mullins." And I turned, and there's this guy's this man was.
And I said, "Scusi ladies, let's live? I don't remember I" He said, "but," I didn't remember I met.
I mean, when we've met you'd hidden out of your mother. "
Risate Oh, that guy.
And, but certainly, I played a camel.
That gentleman was the Dr. Kean, a man that I had met only known about my mother's stories about that day, because, clear, typically, I came out of two weeks.
And so, the ecologist of my mother had gone in vacation, so the man who made me hidden was a complete stranger for my parents.
And because I was born without the peron, and I had the fingers in there, some fingers in this foot, and some of the fingers in this foot, and some in that, he had to be the bad news.
He said, "I had to give this talk to your parents that you won't walk, and that you won't ever walk, and you've given the kind of mobility that have the other children or no independent life, and you've given me to me from then," I'd won't walk through my school, that I'd won't.
that I had marched with the Girl Scout, you know, the Halloween't won't won my studio, or all of my studio, or all of my life's extreme, teaching to the students of the medical school of Hahenemy and Hershey.
And he's called this part of the course, the X, the potential of human will.
There's no projects can hold as much as the poderly in the quality of life of a person's life's life's life's life's.
And the Ph.Dr. Kean continued to explain me, and he said, "In my experience, unless they didn't sell it, and even if it's given a bricie of support, if it's just a baby."
You see Dr. Kean changed his opinion changed his opinion.
It understood that there's a difference between a medical condition and what each can do with it.
And there's been a change in my thinking during the years, in this, if you asked me when I was 15 years old, if you asked me when I was 15 years old, if I'd except a second.
I used that kind of normality at that time.
If you ask it today, I'm not sure.
And it's because of the experiences that I had with them, not because of the experiences I had with them.
and maybe, the change in me, because I've been exposed to the most of the people who have open the door of the people who have opened me.
You can see, everything you need is a person that you're showing you the epiphania of your pots, and you're starting. If you can give someone the chiaves of their strength, the human spirit is so rical, if you can do and open a door for someone at a crucial moment, you're educating the best of the ways.
You're teaching yours.
in fact, the meaning of the word "educate" which means, "which means, pull out what it's inside, to bring the potential.
So again, what's the potential that we want to pull out?
There's a case in the 1960s in Grand break, when they were passing from the middle elementary schools.
It's called the proof continuity,
That's how to separate students dependently.
And the students with the best votes have a harmed program, and higher teachers, okay, they're doing it for a period of three months, Ai students with "they were smart." They said they were smart.
And at the end of this period of three months, they were having the results at the level of "great." And, of course. "And," they were "insufficient." And that "insufficient." And this is what happened to the end of the three months.
What they'd been at school, beyond the ones that I'd leave.
The crucial part of this study was that even the teachers were decept.
The teachers didn't know it was done this change.
He's just been telling: These are the very good students and these are those with insufficient.
And so it's how they started teaching them.
So I think the real disability is to have a damage damage, and a spirit of damage has not hope.
You can't see the beauty.
It doesn't have our natural, infant curiosity and our innate capability to imagine.
if instead, we can support the human spirit to maintain hope, to see the beauty of yourself and in others, to be imaginative and curious, to be imaginative and curious, although we're using our force correctly.
When the spirit has these quality, we can create new reality and new ways of being.
I'd like to leave you with a poet written from a poet of 1300 called Hafiz that made me know my friend Jacquacques Dembois.
and the poem is called "The God who knows just four words," Every child has met God, not the NO, but the God of NO, but the God, but the God that only knows four words and continues to repeat me with me. "
Thank you.

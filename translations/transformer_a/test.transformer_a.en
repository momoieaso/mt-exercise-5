<unk> years ago, here at TED, <unk> <unk> <unk> a challenge of <unk> called the <unk> challenge.
And the idea is very simple.
<unk> of four people need to build the <unk> <unk> that you can <unk> up alone, <unk> 20 <unk>, a <unk> of <unk> <unk>, a <unk> of <unk> and a <unk>.
<unk> must be <unk> at the top of the <unk>.
And, even if it looks very simple, actually, it's quite hard, because it <unk> people to <unk> very quickly.
So I thought it was an interesting idea, and I <unk> it into a <unk> lab.
And it was a huge success.
And since then, I <unk> about 70 <unk> of <unk> <unk> of this kind of around the world with students, designers and <unk>, <unk> <unk> of research and developing companies <unk> 50.
And there's something about this <unk> that <unk> lessons that nature of <unk>, and I'd like to share some of these lessons with you.
<unk>, most of the people start with <unk> to the <unk> to <unk>.
They say, they're <unk> what it might look like, <unk> for the power, then <unk> the <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
It <unk> most of the time <unk> the <unk> in <unk> structures and, at the end, just when it's about to <unk>, some <unk> out the <unk>, and they <unk> the <unk> at the top, they do a <unk> back and <unk>.
<unk> the job.
But what really happens is, most of the time, is that "<unk>" is <unk> in a "<unk>," because the weight of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> the whole structure.
There's a number of people who have a lot more "<unk>" of others, and among the <unk> are the <unk> business <unk>.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and create absolutely <unk> structures.
And there are of course <unk> groups who have a lot more structures <unk>, and among the best, there are the <unk> schools of <unk>.
And it's amazing.
As <unk>, it's not just create the <unk> structures, but they're also the most interesting structures.
And your question will be: How is it possible? Why? What are they <unk>?
And I'm going to say that, "No one of the kids spend time trying to become the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
We don't spend time for the power.
But there's another reason.
And the reason is that the students of economics are <unk> to find the single best project.
And then <unk>.
And then, what happens is that when you look at the <unk> at the top, they don't have more time, and what happens?
<unk>.
<unk> you <unk>? Right.
What children do <unk>, is that they come from <unk>, and they <unk>, one after the other, <unk> always <unk> at the top of the <unk>, and so different <unk> of <unk> <unk> down the <unk>.
The designer <unk> that this kind of <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> process.
And with every version, children have a <unk> <unk> about what works and what doesn't work.
So the ability to work on <unk> is <unk>, but we see how they work on different groups.
The media for most of the people is about 50 <unk>, for the students of economics, about half, <unk>, a little bit better, but not much kids, better than many adults.
Who better than everyone?
<unk> and engineers, thanks to the sky.
<unk> <unk> is the <unk> structure I've ever seen.
And why? Because <unk> that <unk> and <unk> models are the key to build <unk>.
Then we have <unk> <unk>, a little bit better than the media.
But here's where it becomes interesting.
If you take a <unk> <unk>, the group can do much better.
It's amazing. You go a little bit of a <unk>, it's going to be like, "<unk> you can see in <unk>. And why?
Because they have ability to <unk> the <unk> work.
<unk> the process, we <unk> it.
And all the groups that <unk> and <unk> attention to work <unk> <unk> the result of the team.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and their <unk> bring it to a safe success.
If you have 10 groups that work well, you're going to be <unk> structures that are standing.
And I <unk> an interesting experiment.
I thought, I <unk> the <unk> for once.
I put on the <unk> <unk> dollars of <unk> in software team.
What do you think that's happened to design students?
What's the result?
That's what happened.
<unk> of the team created a <unk> structure.
If one of them had built a <unk> <unk> structure, it would bring home to the <unk>.
<unk>'t it interesting that a <unk> high impact?
We <unk> again the <unk> with the same students.
What do you think that happened?
Now they understood the value of a <unk>.
The same team from <unk> has become the best.
They've created the <unk> structure over time.
So are they important lessons about the nature of the <unk> and the success then you would say, why should have time writing a <unk> challenge?
The reason is this: <unk> help create <unk> and <unk> to help groups build cars, <unk> and <unk>.
And what a <unk> challenge is to help <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Why, <unk>, every project has its <unk>, not that?
The challenge is an <unk> experience, common language, a common position to build a <unk>.
And so, this is the value of the experience, of this simple <unk>.
And those of you of <unk>, it can go to <unk>
It's a <unk> where you can take a look at how to build <unk>.
There are <unk> <unk>.
There are <unk> examples from all over the world like people <unk> and <unk> the system.
There's also the world's <unk>.
And the most important lesson, I think, is that design is really a <unk> of contact.
<unk> the <unk> of all the <unk>, and the <unk> of the most <unk> <unk>, the <unk> and <unk> to deal with the challenge that you have in the hand.
And sometimes, a little <unk> of this experience is everything that's necessary to <unk> a moment.
And that can really make a difference.
Thank you very much.
<unk> <unk> you have a machine, great <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, is a time machine.
All in this room must <unk>.
You can go back; you can go back; you can't <unk> where you're.
And I was going to talk about, because I asked me to my friends in the last few days, and they all want to go back.
I don't know. I'm going to go back to the <unk> or Twitter, or "<unk> <unk>."
I don't know.
They are <unk> that there is a kind of <unk> to <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
We <unk> it.
But I'm not part of that group, I have to <unk> it.
I don't want to go back, and it's not because I'm <unk>, it's because the <unk> on this planet, they go.
So I want to go into the car, and I want to go on.
This is the best period that there was on this planet in every field that we can measure: health, wealth, <unk>, <unk> opportunities, <unk> of disease.
There's never been a period like this.
My <unk> <unk>, all of the age of 60.
My <unk> <unk> that number to 70.
My parents are about 80.
So it's better that there's a <unk> at the beginning of the number of years to my death.
But it's not just about people like us, it's a much bigger than this.
A child born in New <unk> today can <unk> us to live as much as a man in the world of 100 years ago.
<unk>. It's an amazing fact.
How does it be true?
<unk>. <unk> has <unk> billion people on this planet.
He changed the <unk> of <unk> as no war has ever done.
If <unk> went. <unk>.
We <unk> it. <unk>.
In the <unk> world, disease that <unk> million people only one generation is no longer, which is basically.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk> --
somebody knows what they are?
<unk>, <unk> medicine, our ability to <unk> billion people, these are <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And to me, the <unk>, to try things, see if they work, <unk> when they don't work, it's one of the great humanity.
These were the good news.
<unk>, they were the good news because there are other problems, and they've been <unk> many times, for example, one billion people goes to bed <unk> on this planet, every day.
This number is <unk>, with incredible <unk>, and it's <unk>.
And not just, we've used our creativity to <unk> to <unk> the planet.
<unk> <unk>, <unk> land, <unk>, gas, natural gas: they're <unk>, and they're <unk> quickly, and if we don't <unk> our <unk> to <unk> out of this <unk>, we also <unk> us.
So the question is, can we do that? I think so.
I think it's clear that it's possible to produce food for <unk> billion people without <unk> the Earth they live on.
I think it's possible to <unk> this world of energy without this <unk>.
I really believe that, and no, it's not a <unk> <unk>.
But here's the thing that <unk> me <unk> at night -- one of the things that <unk> me <unk> the night.
We've never had so much as we needed to <unk> as we need now, and we never have been in the position of <unk> to the best of how we could we do today.
We're at a incredible <unk> events, really, in many <unk>.
But despite this, I think we should go back <unk>, 300 years, first of the <unk>, to find a time when we <unk> the <unk>, a period where we <unk> them, a period of the time when we <unk> them more <unk>, and on <unk>, we're doing right now.
People <unk> in what they <unk>, and they do that with a lot of <unk> that we can't <unk>.
<unk> the truth can <unk>.
<unk>, everybody has their own <unk>; they also have right to its <unk> on the progress, but you know what not right?
You don't have your <unk>. I'm <unk>, you can't.
I got a little bit of <unk>.
A <unk> years ago, I wrote a story about <unk> for "The New <unk>" The <unk>, a short story.
And I was <unk> that somebody <unk>, that was <unk> to what is, after all, the <unk> of public health effective health of the whole human history.
I didn't know what to do, so I did as <unk>, I wrote the story and I went to the other.
Not much later, I wrote a story about <unk> food <unk>.
You know what, just bigger.
People were <unk>.
So I wrote a story also about that, and I'm not going to understand why people were <unk> <unk> as "food show," because I <unk> that <unk> the molecules in a <unk> way, is <unk> the field of nature.
But, as always, I do my job. I wrote the story, and I went on.
I mean, I'm a <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, let's <unk>.
But these stories <unk> and I couldn't figure out why, but I finally got it.
The problem was that those <unk> who were <unk> me were doing <unk> were not <unk> <unk>.
They were people of consciousness, <unk>, people for good.
They were exactly like people in this room.
And the thing that was very --
but then I thought, from, we must be <unk>; we're at a point, on this planet, where we don't have the same relationship with the progress that there was once.
We talk about it <unk>.
We talk about it in terms of <unk> using <unk>: "All right, there are some reasons to do that, and I think we know what they are.
We lost trust in the institutions, and sometimes in science itself, and sometimes in science itself, and it's <unk> that happened.
You just have to do some <unk> and people <unk>.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> of mass <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
I mean, each one has its list.
We've got questions and problems with the people who are <unk> right.
So <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> evidence.
We didn't know anything to <unk>.
But here's the fundamental point, when evidence comes is necessary to <unk>, and we're not very good at this.
And I think the reason that is that we find in a <unk> of fear that I had never seen and I hope I never <unk>.
<unk> 12 years ago, a <unk> story, a <unk> story, who <unk> there was a <unk> between a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> against <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
Very <unk>.
<unk> of studies were made to see if it was true.
And they're going to be hundreds of studies; it's an important issue.
It's the end of the data.
<unk> from the United States, from <unk>, from <unk>, <unk>, and everybody was <unk>, no <unk>, no <unk>, nothing.
It doesn't make it. Not that because we believe in the <unk>, what we see -- what we think we can see, what it makes us feel <unk>.
We don't believe a <unk> of <unk> <unk> from the government that show us numbers, and the <unk>, I think we all <unk> it.
But you know what?
The results were <unk> --
So that's why this is a fact, the United States is one of the few countries in the world where the number of <unk> against the <unk> is <unk>.
It's <unk>, and we should <unk> ourselves.
It's terrible.
What has happened that <unk> us to do something like that?
Now, I'm going to <unk> it.
<unk>, someone here has the <unk>?
<unk> among the audience have ever seen a death person dying?
It doesn't happen often.
In this country, it doesn't happen, but it happened <unk> times in the last year.
I'm a good bit of dead to <unk>, 20 every hour.
But because it didn't happen here, we can <unk> from my head, and people like <unk> <unk> can go around <unk> <unk> of fear and <unk> by <unk> like <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And they can make it because they don't understand the difference between <unk> and <unk>.
They don't forget that these two things seem to be <unk>, but they're never.
But it's something that we need to learn, and we need to <unk> quickly.
This man was a <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
He <unk> humanity from one of his <unk> <unk>.
<unk> fear, no <unk> -- the <unk>, <unk>.
The man at the center, not <unk>.
It's called <unk> <unk>.
It's just created a <unk> against the <unk> together with other people.
It has <unk> life, 500 <unk> children every year in the developing world.
<unk> <unk>, right?
It's <unk>, if it wasn't that <unk> goes around talking about <unk>, it says how much <unk> and that people should just <unk> them.
And they say that in terms.
So <unk> is <unk> a <unk>.
When <unk> talks in a public <unk> can't <unk> without a <unk> <unk>.
They call it at home because of some <unk> <unk> that know where his children go to school.
Why? Because <unk> has created a <unk>.
I don't need to <unk>, but the <unk> are fundamental.
If you <unk>, <unk> disease, <unk> disease, <unk> disease, and it's going on.
We again the <unk> in this country.
And it's going to be worse, and that's not a lot of <unk> kids to die again because it's just a matter of numbers.
And it's not just about <unk>.
<unk>? <unk> that. Why not?
One of my <unk> <unk> wrote a couple of weeks ago, and he told me that <unk> a little <unk>.
<unk> me was <unk>.
She would not <unk> his son against <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
OK.
Why? Because there is no <unk> to us. But you know what?
We had no <unk> in the United States.
Today, I don't know -- maybe a guy's <unk> on a <unk> <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk>, it's now <unk>.
<unk> <unk> in a couple of hours, <unk> a machine, <unk> here to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to one of these <unk> <unk> from TED.
He doesn't know it that we've been <unk> by a <unk> disease, and we don't even know it's how the world works.
This is the planet that we live in. We don't believe that it's not that.
We <unk> <unk>. We wanted to do that.
Did you take the <unk> <unk>?
<unk>, a little bit of <unk> to start the day.
I know you've done it because half of the Americans are doing it every day.
<unk> that stuff, as it <unk> to <unk> medicine, and it doesn't matter how often they are <unk>.
The data always <unk> it.
They <unk> the most <unk>. More than that they're not <unk>, almost ever.
But that's good, you want to <unk> billion dollars for <unk> <unk>, are you!
<unk> <unk>. <unk>.
Why do we do that? Why?
I think of understanding, we <unk> the great <unk> homes.
<unk> the great <unk> machine. We don't <unk>.
And that's good. Our health care system is <unk>.
It's <unk> to millions of people.
It's absolutely incredibly cold and <unk> for those of us who can <unk>.
So let's go away, and from who <unk> us?
<unk> of the great <unk>.
It's great. We <unk> the great <unk>.
You know, it's a serious problem because this stuff is a <unk>, and we're going to take billions of dollars.
I've got all sorts of examples here.
<unk> of these... <unk> -- a <unk>, <unk>, <unk> -- a <unk>, <unk> -- I don't even know what it's about <unk> billion dollars, and it's a <unk>.
You know one thing? When I say these things, the people <unk> me against, and they say, "But what are you interested in? You know that people do what they want.
It's good at it. "
Do you have a little bit? You know.
Because I don't care about whether it's the <unk> of <unk> for the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> to say, "<unk>, I don't have <unk> to listen to the evidence of the experts in the <unk> <unk>.
When you <unk> the road that <unk> to <unk> science and evidence with <unk> and <unk>, I would <unk> it to be.
<unk> like <unk> <unk> in South Africa.
He <unk> <unk> of his <unk> <unk> to say that <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> better than the drugs that we know can <unk> the <unk> of <unk>.
<unk> of thousands of <unk> <unk> in one country which has been <unk> more than any other from this disease.
<unk>, not <unk> to <unk> that there are no consequences for these <unk>.
There are always there.
Now, the <unk> <unk> that we are in the middle right now is the war between the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> food.
It's a <unk> <unk>. <unk>.
It's a <unk> of the words on the <unk>.
It's <unk>, it's not science.
Every single thing that <unk>, every <unk> of <unk>, every <unk> of <unk>, every <unk> of <unk> was <unk> by the man.
You see, there were no <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
There were no <unk>.
There were no <unk> trees. We <unk> them.
We've done this over the last <unk> years.
<unk> worked and something else doesn't.
And we <unk> what we don't know.
Now we can do this more <unk>.
And there are <unk>, of course, there are.
But we can <unk> things like <unk> A in <unk>, and this <unk> million people, <unk> their lives.
And we don't want to do that?
I've got to say, I'm not <unk>.
We are interested in the <unk>.
Why?
The things I hear are always: <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, we don't want huge <unk> with the same thing, it's wrong.
We don't want the <unk> of <unk> on life.
We don't want <unk> that <unk> are <unk> <unk>.
Do you know what's my answer to this?
It's yes. You're right. <unk> something.
It's true, we have a huge food problem, but it's not science.
It has nothing to do with science.
It's law, <unk>, <unk>.
You know well that science is not a <unk>.
It's not a country.
It's not even an idea; it's a process.
It's a process, sometimes <unk> results <unk> sometimes not, but the idea that we shouldn't <unk> to the science to do its work because we have fear is actually very <unk>, and it's <unk> to millions of people of <unk>.
You know, in the next 50 years, we're going to <unk> 70 percent.
These are the <unk> in Africa over the last 30 years.
<unk>. <unk>.
We need it, and we don't care.
Why? <unk> <unk>.
We don't want to <unk> people to eat like <unk>.
<unk> billion people <unk>.
<unk> a little bit of a <unk>.
But it's just <unk>. <unk>. <unk>.
He didn't <unk> <unk>, but scientists are <unk>, but scientists are <unk> the way of <unk> right right now.
So many people could eat and <unk> the risk of becoming <unk>.
Don't worry about <unk>, and you know what?
It wouldn't be a good <unk>. It wouldn't be a <unk> of <unk>, but it would be very nice.
<unk> <unk> only: Why are we against?
I mean, <unk>: Why are we <unk> this thing?
Just because we don't want to <unk> genes here and there?
It's about genes. It's not about <unk> <unk>.
It's not our <unk> <unk> for <unk>, or our <unk> to have bigger food, better, simple.
There are no <unk> <unk>.
It's about save people's lives, and it would be now <unk> to understand what it means.
Why do you want to <unk>? -- if you don't <unk> it, and we'll start <unk> as we <unk> now, <unk> <unk> of something that I don't think <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
There's no other way to <unk> what's going on.
It's <unk>, it's <unk>, it's <unk>, and we have to <unk>.
So after this conversation <unk>, you might ask, "Can you go into this <unk> machine of time and go into the future?"
<unk>! I want.
It's <unk> now, but we have an amazing opportunity.
We can <unk> the time machine as we want.
We have the chance to go where we want, and we're going to do where we want.
We've got to do these <unk>, and we have to think, but when we go into the car of the time and we're going to be happy to do that.
I know that we can and, as far as I am about, I think the world needs to be right now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
One day, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> to the streets of <unk> <unk> <unk> when I was a <unk> music.
<unk> <unk> by a man, a <unk> man, fascinating with <unk> <unk>, <unk> with no <unk>, who had two <unk>.
I'm <unk> a story that many of you know, because the <unk> <unk> <unk> for the <unk> of a book, which, later, was <unk> to the great screen, with <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> the part of <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> in the part of <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> in the part of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> the <unk>, <unk> a terrible <unk> <unk>, and 30 years later, <unk> as a <unk> <unk> to the streets of <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
I'm going to read the book of <unk> or <unk>'s book, or look at the film to understand not just the <unk> <unk> that <unk> between these two men,
My name is <unk> <unk>. I'm a <unk> of <unk>.
<unk> online games.
To do this, I have a plan, and I'm going to <unk> the most <unk> time to play more <unk> games and interesting.
<unk> <unk> three billion hours a week, <unk> online.
And some of you might think, "<unk> a good bit of time to play."
maybe too long, <unk> how many problems we have to solve the real world.
In fact, <unk> to my research, <unk> the <unk> for <unk>, actually, is the opposite.
<unk> billion hours a week are not <unk> to solve the most <unk> problems of the world.
In fact, I think if we want to survive the next century on this planet, we need to increase that <unk>.
I've <unk> that the total of which we need is <unk> billion hours of play every week.
It's probably a <unk> <unk> idea, so the <unk>, to <unk> the concept.
If we want to solve that <unk>, poverty, <unk> change, <unk> change, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, I think we have to have the <unk> of play online, for at least <unk> billion hours of hours to <unk>, for the end of the next <unk>. No, I'm <unk>, really.
That's why. This image is why I think that play is so important for the <unk> of the human species. <unk>.
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, wanted to <unk> the <unk> of the game.
So he <unk> <unk> while he <unk>.
And this is a <unk> <unk>.
If you're not <unk> <unk>, you can <unk> some of the <unk> of this photograph.
You probably see the sense of <unk>, a little bit of fear, but it's also a <unk> <unk>, a very <unk> problem with a very difficult problem.
If you're <unk>, you're <unk>, you're <unk> around the eyes, and around the <unk> are a <unk> of <unk>.
And <unk> <unk> show <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk> to a <unk> from something called a "<unk> <unk>."
<unk>, it's a term you already heard. OK.
So we have <unk> <unk> between us.
A <unk> <unk> is such a <unk> result that you don't look at when you're not <unk> it.
It's almost beyond the <unk> of imagination, and when it <unk> is a <unk> to find out what you're really capable. This is a <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> is a <unk> <unk>.
And this is the expression that we need to see on the <unk> of millions of <unk> in the world as we <unk> the <unk> of the next hundred years. <unk> the expression of somebody who, all of the <unk> is to a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> this is the expression that we see in the life of every day as we try to deal with <unk> problems.
This is the expression I call "I'm not <unk> in the <unk> <unk>." And I'm in <unk>.
I'm with the expression "I'm not <unk> in the <unk> <unk>."
This is a <unk> in my old neighborhood in California, where I did the <unk> about why we're better at the game that we're better at the play of life.
And this is a problem with a lot of <unk> <unk>: we feel that in reality we are not as good as games.
And I don't mean good "just like" <unk> "success," even if the success is part: it's going to be more results in online <unk>.
But I also mean, "good" "in the sense of <unk> to do something important, let's start <unk> and <unk>.
And when we're in an online world, I think a lot of us become the best <unk> of themselves, the <unk> <unk> to help without <unk>, more capable of <unk> on a problem for all the time necessary, of <unk> after a <unk> and <unk>.
And in real life, when we <unk> a <unk>, when we get a <unk>, we don't feel like this: we feel <unk>, we feel <unk>, maybe <unk>, <unk> or <unk>.
I'm not going to see these <unk> as they just don't exist in a game.
So this is what I wanted to study in university.
What is that in a game <unk> us to feel that we can't get any <unk>?
How can we <unk> those <unk> from games and <unk> the real world?
So I studied games like <unk> of <unk>, which is really the <unk> environment to <unk> problems.
And I started <unk> some things that make <unk> <unk> so possible in the online <unk>.
The first is that, when you go to one of these <unk> online games, especially in <unk> of <unk>, there are <unk> different <unk> that are <unk> at the point of a mission to save the world. <unk> by now.
But not any mission: a perfectly <unk> <unk> to your current level in the game. Right?
So you can <unk> it.
They'll never give you a <unk> challenge.
But it's at the <unk> of <unk>. So you have to <unk>.
But there's no <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, you don't spend time <unk> <unk>, there is always something <unk> and important to do.
And there are also <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, hundreds of thousands of people, <unk> to you to <unk> your mission.
It's not such a <unk> thing in real life, this feeling that we have <unk> <unk>.
And there's also this <unk> <unk>, this <unk> that <unk>, because we're there, and what we're doing.
And then <unk> this <unk> <unk> --
You've heard of <unk> and <unk> one of <unk> and <unk> of <unk>, and <unk> it into intelligence.
We don't <unk> that kind of <unk> <unk> in real life.
When you take this stage, you don't have to a <unk> <unk>, and let me <unk> one in <unk> ideas.
We don't <unk> that kind of <unk> in real life.
Now, the problem with <unk> online as a <unk> of <unk> is so much <unk> to be a <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> all the moments, which <unk> to <unk> our time in these <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is better than reality.
This is why, <unk>, <unk> all the <unk> of <unk> of <unk> have spent <unk> million years <unk> to solve the <unk> issues of <unk>.
This is not a <unk> thing.
But <unk> in perspective: <unk> million years ago was the time when one of our <unk> <unk> up.
That was the first <unk> to walk <unk>.
Okay, so when we're talking about how much time we're <unk> in play, the only <unk> way to <unk>, is to talk about <unk> of human evolution, which is an extraordinary thing, but also useful, because we found that we <unk> all this time playing, we're <unk> what we are capable of human, we're <unk> to <unk> and have more heart.
That's true, I believe that.
So this interesting <unk> <unk>.
It was <unk> by a <unk> to the university <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> young <unk> today in a country with a strong culture of <unk> <unk>, will have been <unk> hours <unk> online, to <unk> years old.
<unk> hours is an interesting number for two reasons.
First of all, for children in the United States <unk> hours is the <unk> number of hours that steps in school from <unk> <unk> to <unk> if you're in the present every day.
So we have a whole <unk> of <unk> education in which <unk> young people like being <unk> ♪ ♪ <unk> at the time in which everything else.
And some of you will probably read the new <unk> book, "<unk>."
If you've done it read about his theory of success, the theory of <unk> hours for success.
It's based on a <unk> research in the field of <unk>, which is that if you have <unk> hours of a <unk> <unk> to any time at the age of <unk> genes in that field.
We're good at that something as the best people in the world.
So, what we have now on is a whole generation of young people who are <unk> genes.
So the question is, "<unk>, what do you know?"
because if we could understand what we could be available a amount of human resources without <unk> <unk>.
This is the number of people in the world that <unk> at least an hour a day to play online online.
These are our genes.
500 million people who are <unk> <unk> -- in something.
And in the next <unk> we'll have another billion <unk> <unk> who are good at that something.
If you're not <unk>, this is what we <unk> us: the <unk> industry is <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> energy and work with the <unk> instead of the Internet, particularly China, China, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> is one billion <unk> in the next <unk>.
This <unk> us to <unk> billion <unk>.
So I started thinking about what <unk> these games are <unk> us in the genes.
These are four <unk> I <unk>. The first is a <unk> <unk>.
Okay. <unk> like a <unk> shape.
A <unk> <unk> is the <unk> to <unk> immediately to deal with a <unk>, with the <unk> to have a <unk> <unk> of success.
The <unk> <unk> always <unk> that a <unk> <unk> is possible and that will always be <unk> to <unk>, and <unk> now.
The <unk> <unk> are not with their hands.
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> in <unk> a social <unk>.
There are a lot of interesting research that shows how we're better with other people after <unk> with them, even though they <unk> us.
And the reason is that it takes a lot of trust to play with someone: we have trust that <unk> their time with us, <unk> with the same rules and the same <unk>, and <unk> to the <unk> of the game.
So, play together <unk> <unk> of trust and <unk>.
We think we have a lot more <unk> social relationships.
<unk> <unk>. <unk>.
You know, there's one reason for which the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> hours a week, almost how much a <unk> job.
It's because we know, as we're <unk>, that we're actually more <unk>, rather than <unk> or <unk> time.
We know that we're <unk>, as humans, to work <unk> to something that has meaning.
And the <unk> <unk> are <unk> to work <unk>, if it's <unk> a <unk> task.
<unk>, a <unk> meaning.
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> to be <unk> to <unk>, to <unk> human stories.
For example, a little information to help create a context.
They all <unk>, the largest <unk> in the world.
The second largest <unk> in the world, with almost <unk> <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> million people use this every month.
They've <unk> more information on the Internet <unk>, which is on any other <unk> in the world.
We had to <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> a <unk> source of information <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
Okay, these are the four <unk> that <unk> together one thing.
The <unk> <unk> are individuals of great <unk> of <unk>.
These are people who <unk> to be able to change the world.
The only problem is that we're able to be able to change the <unk> <unk> but not that real.
This is the problem that I'm trying to solve.
There's a <unk> called <unk> <unk>.
His studies are <unk>. It's <unk> the reason why people spend so much time, energy and money, in the online <unk>.
And he said, "We're <unk> what nothing less than a mass <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of online game."
And it's a <unk>, so it's <unk>, and he says -- not as me, I'm a <unk> of games, I'm <unk> --
But he <unk> -- he <unk> that this is perfectly <unk> thing, because <unk> <unk> can get more in online <unk> than in real life.
You have to have more social social <unk> in a game that not in real life.
It <unk> a better <unk> and <unk> <unk> in a game that not in real life.
So, <unk>, for now, it's perfectly <unk> for the <unk> <unk>, spend more time in the <unk> <unk> that in the real world. Even I agree that this is <unk>, it's <unk>, in no way, a <unk> situation. We need to start to make the real world more like a game.
Here we are <unk> from something that <unk> years ago.
These are <unk> <unk>, made of <unk> <unk> to have <unk> and <unk> we had <unk> <unk>. And these <unk> the first <unk> by <unk>.
If you look at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, you'll see this story already.
It's the story of the <unk> and why.
<unk> <unk> that games, particularly <unk> games, were <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, during a period of <unk>.
I thought the <unk> was so <unk>, that the <unk> of <unk> <unk> to do something <unk>.
People <unk>, the population was in <unk>, it was a <unk> situation, they needed a <unk> solution.
So, <unk> to <unk>, <unk> games and <unk> <unk> <unk> for all the <unk>.
One day, everyone would <unk>.
The next day, everyone would <unk>.
And they <unk> so deeply in <unk> games, from the moment that play is so <unk>, and we <unk> it into a state of <unk> <unk>, which <unk> the fact of not having anything to eat.
And so one day, a <unk> day.
And in <unk>, I was so 18 years old, <unk> to the <unk> <unk> a day and <unk> that <unk>.
I think that's exactly the way we use games games at the day today.
It <unk> games to <unk> the <unk> of the real world.
<unk> to <unk> from everything that it doesn't work in our real environment, from everything that we don't care about real life, and <unk> what we need from games.
But we don't have to be <unk> here.
This is interesting: <unk> to <unk>, after 18 years, the <unk> didn't have to improve, so the <unk> <unk> <unk> that would <unk> one last <unk> to <unk>.
<unk> the entire <unk> <unk>, <unk> a <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> of that <unk> <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk>.
We <unk> the <unk> and <unk> to look at a new land where we live, <unk> behind the <unk> number of people to survive with the resources available, with the hope to bring their <unk> from some other hand, where they could have <unk>.
It's a little <unk> idea, right?
But <unk>, studies, studies, they <unk> that they would take <unk> to the <unk> <unk>, <unk> the same DNA of the <unk> <unk>.
So <unk>, scientists have <unk> that the story of <unk> is a real story.
And <unk> have found <unk> of a global <unk> that <unk> almost 20 years, and that could explain the <unk>.
So this incredible story could be true: they could have actually <unk> their <unk> culture, <unk> in games for 18 years to then be so <unk>, and know that well as as <unk> meeting in the game meeting.
Okay, we can do that.
<unk> to <unk> from <unk>.
It was the first of <unk> game in real time time in real time time.
<unk> <unk> for 18 years, we have <unk> at <unk> for 16 years.
I say, we're <unk> for our <unk> game.
<unk> <unk> half of the population <unk> to a new world.
It's from here that <unk> the idea of <unk> billion hours a week.
<unk> that half of us have <unk> to spend an hour a day to play, until we <unk> the real world's problems.
<unk> what you're for asking, "How are we going to solve the real world in a game?" Well, this is what I <unk> my job during the <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
So in our <unk> <unk>, we have this <unk> that <unk> our idea of how we should be <unk> with the future.
We don't want to <unk> the future.
What we want to do is to <unk> the future.
We want to imagine the <unk> from the best results, and then we want to give the chance to the people to <unk> actually <unk>.
We want to imagine <unk> <unk> to give people the tools to <unk>.
I'm going to show you three games that I'm a <unk> to give people the tools to create <unk> <unk> in their future.
This is "<unk> <unk>."
We made this game in <unk>.
It's an online game where you're trying to survive a <unk> of oil.
The <unk> isn't real, but we've published <unk> online online to make sure that it is, and to make real life real as if you can <unk> it. So, when you look at the game, we <unk> up in the area of <unk>, and we give you to the <unk> area, and we give you the real cost of the <unk>, the things that are not available, the impact of food,
The impact on the <unk>, if schools are <unk>, if there are <unk>, and you've got to think about how to <unk> your life if this was real. <unk> you to have a <unk> on this, of <unk> video, of <unk>, <unk> photos.
We <unk> this game with <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, and we <unk> them since then for the three years <unk>, and what I can tell you is a <unk> experience.
No one wants to change the way they live because it is a good thing for the world or why it is a <unk>.
But if we <unk> them in a <unk> <unk> and the <unk>, "we don't oil anymore.
This is an amazing story. A <unk> to which you can <unk>.
You can see as <unk>. "
Most of our <unk> <unk> has learned in the game.
So, for the next game, we decided to save the world, we decided to <unk> <unk>, to a bigger problem than the oil <unk>.
We made a game called <unk>, to <unk> for the <unk>, and the <unk> was: a <unk> has <unk> that humanity has only a few other <unk> years on this planet.
The <unk> is called "<unk> of <unk> <unk>."
We asked people to <unk> online <unk> like a <unk> movie.
We <unk> them the <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> a team from: there is the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, and they all have something to do to save the world, but in our game, instead of having five people in the dream team, and that's <unk> the future of the team.
Some people have <unk> for eight weeks, they <unk> 500 <unk> solutions that you can find if you go online and <unk> on Google "<unk>."
<unk>, the last game, <unk> <unk>. This is a <unk> game with the <unk> of World <unk>.
If you look at the <unk> game from the World <unk> <unk>, like <unk>, <unk>.
<unk> with <unk> university <unk> for Africa, we're <unk> them to learn about social innovation.
There's a story in <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> through <unk> to <unk> like local knowledge, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> <unk> all of you to share this game with young people, everywhere in the world, particularly in the developing world, which could <unk> <unk> by <unk> to begin to imagine their own social <unk> to save the world.
It's time to <unk>.
I want to ask a question.
What do you think about?
We all have these incredible <unk>, we have these games that are <unk> projects of what we could do, but none of these are still <unk> the real world.
Well, I hope that I agree with me that <unk> <unk> are a human <unk> that we can use to do the work in the real world, that <unk> are a powerful <unk> for change, which we have these incredible <unk>, a <unk> <unk>, the ability to <unk> a social <unk>, this <unk> <unk> <unk>, this <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of a <unk> meaning.
I really hope that we can <unk> to play with games that are <unk>, to survive on this planet for another century, and my hope is that I'm <unk> to you to me in <unk> and make games like these.
So when we go to the next <unk>, two things are <unk>: that we can make any future of imagine, and that we can play at any game to play.
So, I say: We started to games that <unk> the world.
Thank you.
For some time, I <unk> to the <unk> effect, it may seem like a <unk> thing that a <unk> <unk> is <unk> by my point of view of <unk> is <unk> at <unk>. "In other words, the <unk> of <unk>." In other words, the <unk> of <unk> have a <unk> effect in some studies, the <unk> effect, just because the person thinks of the studies, the <unk>, just because the person thinks
that what's happening is at a <unk> or something like --
The <unk> of pain, for example, if I try to have a <unk> effect in the body called <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of <unk> becomes something true for the <unk> that if it has.
I want to show you a <unk> <unk> <unk>, very simple.
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a <unk> that's in all the books for children since <unk>.
I learned it by just <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> it for you and so <unk> it.
And so I'm going to <unk> you.
That's what happens.
The <unk>, you can <unk>; my hand, you can <unk>.
I just <unk> my <unk> in my <unk>, like this.
<unk> <unk>.
To be sure that nothing <unk> or <unk> from my <unk>.
Now I'm going to <unk> my <unk> like this.
And so that you can see something that's ever going on. <unk> <unk> here goes up or <unk> my <unk>.
And the purpose of this is simple.
<unk> to open my hand, and if everything has been fine, my animal <unk> <unk> the <unk>.
It's actually so <unk> to its place that I can <unk>, and the <unk> doesn't <unk>.
<unk> goes up or down from my <unk>.
no <unk>. You can <unk> anything.
<unk>!
This is a <unk> that often <unk> children.
which are <unk> to <unk>, because you can learn a lot about <unk> <unk> this <unk> even if it's very simple.
Many of you in this room <unk> this <unk>.
Here's what happens is what the <unk> in my hand.
<unk> <unk> my <unk>.
to <unk> anything <unk> or <unk> from my <unk>, this is a <unk>.
The reason I'm <unk> <unk> is because that's the secret of <unk>.
At the moment my hand was <unk> from you, this <unk> here, my <unk>, this <unk> here, my <unk>, was <unk> by <unk>, in a <unk> <unk>.
There is somebody who didn't have a <unk> here.
It's like that from here, right.
And when I was also <unk> me.
We can talk about why it's <unk>, because we're not just three <unk> <unk> because the mind, and the way that we <unk> information, not <unk>, one, two, three. <unk> them.
But that's not the point. Right? And when I <unk> my hand, <unk> <unk> not through the animal <unk>, but through the <unk>, <unk> my <unk> here.
And when I <unk> my <unk>, same thing, when I <unk> back, this movement <unk> the <unk> <unk> that I <unk>.
<unk> your hand. The <unk> comes away.
It's a <unk> you can do with your friends and close. Thank you.
Now, what has to do with the <unk> effect?
I read a study, a year ago that <unk> my mind.
I'm not a doctor or a <unk>, where it was a <unk> thing.
It seems that if you <unk> a <unk> in the shape of a <unk> <unk>, made as a <unk> <unk>, a <unk> effect.
But if you look at the shape and <unk> the <unk>, as a smaller <unk>, and blue color, and I'm going to give you a letter is more effective.
Even though any of the two <unk> <unk> -- they are <unk>.
But a <unk> <unk> is not effective as a blue <unk>.
What? It really <unk> me.
But anyway, it's not here they <unk>.
<unk> are more <unk> than the <unk> of every shape.
A <unk> <unk>, which is <unk> from one side and <unk> on the other is better than a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> has a role.
A <unk> twice a day is not as effective <unk> as three <unk> -- now I don't remember the statistics. <unk>.
But the point is --
that these <unk> have a role.
And also, the shape is a role.
And if you want the <unk> <unk>, you have to use a <unk>.
Right? A <unk> <unk> with something -- a couple of <unk> of something <unk>.
I <unk> it into a patient --
This is an image so strong in their mind, much <unk> than the <unk> <unk>.
It's real, this graph I'll show you another time when we have <unk> <unk>.
The point is that the <unk> <unk> is not effective as the blue that is not effective as a <unk>.
And none of them have a <unk> quality.
It's just your <unk> that makes them <unk> in your <unk> and <unk> the effect.
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and let a <unk> <unk>.
And do something that is a <unk> <unk> and make it look real.
And we know from the study that when you want a effect you have to use the <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk>, very <unk>.
<unk> it a little bit.
This is my <unk>. This is not special <unk> of <unk>.
This is my skin. This is not a special effect.
I'm about to <unk> my skin and <unk> this <unk> up to <unk>.
If <unk> <unk> -- if I could easily <unk> -- I did it for some friends in the <unk> <unk>, the other night, and for some I don't know, and a woman is almost <unk>.
So if you can easily <unk>, I'm not going to <unk> for the next <unk> actually, you know, I'm going to do the first part here.
You can see, you can look at another side.
Here's what happens, right here, the beginning of my arm <unk> at the low <unk> of my arm just just a little hole.
<unk>. Are you <unk>?
And now a little through my skin, and out of the other side, like this.
Now, we are in the same position where we were with the <unk> of <unk>.
<unk> or less. You can't <unk> my <unk> now, right?
So I'm going to show you. Here's one, two, four, you know.
I know what people think about it.
I said, "<unk> it's not going to be <unk> from <unk> to the skin to <unk> a few minutes."
So, let me give you a <unk>.
How do that? <unk> good.
Yeah, I know <unk> there behind <unk>. "Okay, I'm not seen it well."
People in the <unk> are <unk>.
You have to show <unk>.
This is really my skin. It's not a special effect.
This is my <unk>, and I can <unk> it.
<unk>, if you look <unk> at one other side, don't look at it.
People at the bottom or they're going to <unk> in a few years the <unk> video, "<unk>, it's clear that <unk> some effect, but if it was --
You see there's a hole here and a hole here, if it was true <unk>. "
Now, let me go out a little bit of blood for you.
That's here.
<unk> now <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> my arm, and I'm going to show you that there are no <unk>.
But I believe that in this context and with the idea of taking something <unk> and <unk> it into something real, the <unk> <unk> is, and I'm <unk> from the stage.
We'll see several times in the next few days we're not going to be <unk>. Thank you very much.
So in my life I met a lot of fish.
I just <unk> two.
The first one, <unk> <unk> more than another story of a <unk> story.
It was a <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> one of the most <unk> on the <unk>.
What fish.
<unk> even better, it was from a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So, you're <unk> with consciousness in <unk>.
I was <unk> in a relationship with this beauty for several months.
One day, the head of the company <unk> me and <unk> to talk to a <unk> event at the <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
"<unk>" I said.
This was a company that <unk> to solve what's <unk> a <unk> problem for our <unk>.
How do we continue to have fish in our <unk>?
In the last 50 years we have been <unk> in the <unk> in the same way we have <unk> to the <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> was <unk>.
90 percent of the great fish, the ones that <unk> us so much the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> <unk>.
There's almost nothing <unk>.
So, we <unk> or not the <unk>, the <unk> of fish, we're going to be part of our future.
There are a lot of <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> fish, for the less than they are, and they're <unk>. <unk> for example.
A big problem is that there's a <unk> rate of food <unk> to one.
This means that it takes 15 <unk> of <unk> fish to get a <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
It's not very sustainable.
And the <unk> is not a great <unk>.
So here's a company, finally, there was a company that <unk> to do it in the right way.
I wanted to <unk>.
The day before the event I <unk> at the <unk> of the company.
<unk> <unk>.
"<unk>," I said, "so much good to understand, you're ready to make <unk> so far, in open sea, that don't <unk>."
"<unk>," he said, "We are so <unk> from the coast that our <unk> are <unk>, not <unk>."
And then we're like, "We're <unk> a world."
The rate of <unk>? <unk> to one said.
"The best in the sector."
Let's go to a <unk>, great.
"<unk> to one thing? What would you want to eat the fish?"
"<unk> <unk>," he said. "
"<unk>," I said. "I'm going to <unk>.
That night, I was in bed, <unk>: But what <unk> is a sustainable <unk>?
So the day later, a little bit of the event, we still <unk>.
He said, "<unk>, are you going to <unk> <unk>?"
He said he didn't know, and he would asked around.
Well, let's start with a little bit of the company and no one <unk> <unk> response.
You finally <unk> with the <unk> <unk>.
He also <unk> him.
"<unk>," I said, "are you some of <unk> <unk>?"
Well, he <unk> a few <unk> <unk> of fish <unk> and then said, "<unk> <unk>."
<unk>: "<unk> <unk>?"
He said, "Yes, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk> to <unk>."
He said, "<unk> of your <unk> is made of <unk>?"
<unk>, let's say, two percent.
"Well, it's about 30 percent," he said.
He said, "<unk>, what is sustainable to give <unk> fish?"
And there was a long <unk> at the phone, and then he said, "there are <unk> <unk> in the world."
I <unk> this fish.
No, because I'm one of those <unk> <unk> of good food and traditional food.
Well, to say the truth is.
No, I really <unk> about this fish, because, I <unk> you after that conversation, the fish knew about <unk>.
The second fish is a story of different love.
It's a <unk> story that kind of story that sort of <unk> the fish and more <unk> it.
I saw it for the first time in a <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
A <unk> <unk> had told me about this fish.
<unk> had <unk> us.
<unk> on the table had a white color, almost <unk>.
The <unk> had <unk> him too much.
<unk> the <unk> of how much it had to be.
<unk>, it was <unk>.
Who is able to make a good <unk> after <unk>?
I don't, but this guy yes.
<unk> <unk>.
It's actually called <unk>.
No, it didn't <unk> the fish, and it's not a <unk>.
For the less, not in the sense that it <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. The <unk> which is a <unk> of fish in the <unk> corner of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> at the '<unk> was <unk> by <unk>.
We were <unk> on what it was <unk> a <unk> area.
<unk> <unk> the Earth <unk> a series of <unk> <unk> <unk> so the water in the river.
Well, we couldn't make it work out what it's not <unk>.
And, from the <unk> point of view, it was a <unk>.
He had <unk> something like 90 percent of the birds and, <unk> the place, it's about many birds.
So, in <unk> a company <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> the ground.
What do you know?
<unk> the flow of <unk>.
<unk>, <unk> the <unk>.
Instead of <unk> the water away from the ground <unk> to <unk>.
We <unk> all the <unk>.
We had a <unk> of fish from <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and in this process, <unk> and this company <unk> completely <unk>.
The <unk> is incredible.
I mean, it's never seen something like this.
<unk> the <unk> that seems to be <unk> a million miles, and all that <unk> are <unk> <unk> and this <unk>, <unk> <unk> land.
I was there a little time ago with <unk>.
It's an amazing kind of three <unk> <unk> and a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk>? <unk> <unk> in the middle of this <unk> and I <unk>, <unk>, I had the <unk> to the <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk> his lesson of biology.
I was a little white <unk>.
And then I <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, then you see a kind of <unk> fish that <unk> the <unk> of <unk>.
<unk> out that <unk> <unk> most of his career at <unk> <unk> <unk> in Africa.
I asked him how he got a <unk> of fish.
He said, "<unk>? I don't know about fish.
I'm a <unk> <unk>. "
And immediately after it's <unk> in <unk> birds, <unk> and <unk> plants.
We didn't know, all this was very fascinating, which is, which is, one thing as the <unk> community <unk>.
Yes, it's interesting, but I was <unk>.
And my head <unk> <unk> to that <unk> fish <unk> that I had <unk> the night <unk>.
So I <unk> it and I said, "<unk>, what makes your fish so good?"
He <unk> the <unk>.
"I know, I know, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, relationships, yes, it's amazing.
But what do you know?
What is your <unk> rate?
Well, I <unk> <unk> about how their <unk> is a system so <unk> that the <unk> fish <unk> exactly what <unk> fish <unk> in a <unk> environment.
The <unk> of plants, the <unk>, the <unk>, is all that <unk> the fish.
The system is so <unk>.
There are no <unk>.
Have you ever heard of a <unk> you never heard of the animals?
<unk>, I was <unk> around the ground with <unk> and I said, "In a place like this, it looks so natural different than any <unk> you've ever seen, how do you <unk> the success?"
At that moment, it was as if the <unk> of a movie had <unk> the <unk> of <unk>.
We <unk> the corner and we <unk> a scene between the most incredible thousands of <unk>, and thousands of <unk> <unk> a real <unk> <unk> <unk>.
"That's the success," he said.
"<unk> their <unk>, they are <unk>.
<unk> <unk>. "
<unk>? I was completely <unk>.
He said, "<unk>, but they're not <unk> with your fish?"
"Yes," she said.
"<unk> about 20 percent of the fish and <unk> of fish <unk> for the birds.
<unk> year on this <unk> there were <unk> birds over <unk> species.
Today it became the largest and one of the most important <unk> <unk> <unk> for birds in all Europe. "
He said, "<unk>, but a <unk> population of birds are not the last thing that <unk> in a fish <unk>?"
<unk> your head, no.
We are <unk> <unk> not <unk>.
This is a <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk>.
So much more the <unk> is the <unk> of the best <unk> is the system. "
Okay, then <unk>: A <unk> that doesn't <unk> the animals and <unk> its success <unk> to its own <unk> health of its <unk>.
A <unk> of fish, but also a <unk> for birds.
<unk>, by the way, those <unk> shouldn't even <unk>.
<unk> the <unk> in a <unk> city <unk> miles where the conditions are better for building <unk>.
Every morning, <unk> for <unk> miles, and they get to the <unk> and every night, you're doing other <unk> miles for <unk>.
They do it because they're able to follow the <unk> line of <unk> <unk>.
<unk>.
<unk> something like the <unk> of the <unk> so <unk> <unk>.
And I said, "<unk>, <unk> for <unk> miles up to the <unk> and then <unk> <unk> miles of night to <unk>?
They do it for their little? "
<unk> me as if I just <unk> a song of <unk> <unk>.
He said, "No, they do it because food is better."
I didn't talk about the skin of my fish <unk> that was <unk>, and to me not <unk> the skin of the fish.
I don't like to <unk>, I don't like <unk>.
It's that <unk> <unk>, as <unk>.
I don't know it almost ever.
And yet, when I <unk> it in that <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> had no <unk> <unk>.
He had a <unk> <unk> and <unk> was like <unk> <unk> to the ocean.
<unk> this in <unk>, and he <unk>.
He said, "The skin is like a <unk>.
It's the last <unk> before anything happened in the fish body.
It's <unk> for <unk>. "
And then he said, "But our water doesn't <unk>."
Okay. One <unk> that doesn't <unk> his fish.
A <unk> that <unk> their success on its <unk> <unk>.
And then I realized that when he says that the <unk> didn't have <unk> <unk> a lot of <unk> because the water that <unk> comes from the <unk> <unk>, which is a river that brings with all the things that the <unk> <unk> <unk> to bring <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And when it comes the system, and it <unk> the water is more <unk> than when it's <unk>.
The system is so <unk>, that <unk> water.
So not just a <unk> that doesn't <unk> his animals not just a <unk> that <unk> its success <unk> to the health of its <unk>, but a <unk> that's literally a <unk> of <unk> of the water and not just for those fish but to me and for you.
Because when the water <unk>, it's got to the <unk>.
It's a <unk> in the ocean, I know, but I <unk> <unk> the <unk>, and so you can also do it because this love as <unk> is also <unk>.
You could say it's a <unk> for the future of good food is that it's <unk> fish that they <unk>.
What we need now need is a new <unk> <unk> of agriculture that food has really a good <unk>.
But for a lot of people, this is too <unk>.
We're not <unk>, we <unk> food.
We are <unk>.
We <unk> the little <unk>.
<unk> the little <unk> <unk>.
<unk> of the local food <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
And when you imagine that these are the things that <unk> the future of good food somewhere somewhere somewhere <unk> and says, "<unk> you, even me <unk> the <unk> <unk>, but how are we able to <unk> the whole world?
How do you <unk> the world? "
Can I be <unk>?
It's a question I don't like that.
No, it's not because it's already more than <unk> enough to <unk> the world.
A billion people are <unk> today.
One billion -- more than what you've ever been -- because of the huge <unk> in the <unk>, not the amount of <unk>.
You see, I don't like this question because it <unk> the <unk> of our food system over the last 50 years.
<unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk>, <unk> <unk> to the <unk> fish, and all of this period of the <unk> industry asked simply, "If we can get to <unk> more people in a <unk> way, what is it wrong with what we do?"
This was the <unk>.
It was the <unk>.
It was the business plan of <unk> agriculture.
<unk> <unk> for what is, an industry in <unk> a industry which is <unk> the <unk> capital production that makes <unk> production possible.
This is not a industry, and it's not a industry.
Our <unk> today is <unk> not because of the <unk> in <unk> but for the resources in <unk>, not for the last <unk> <unk>, but for the <unk> <unk>, not for the <unk>, but for the <unk> water, but for the <unk> and not for <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, but for the fish in the sea.
<unk> <unk> the world?
<unk> <unk>: How are we going to <unk> ourselves?
Or better, how can we create the conditions that can <unk> every community of <unk> itself?
To do that, we don't look at the <unk> model of the future industry.
It's an old and <unk> model.
<unk> it all about capital, and chemistry and <unk>, and it has never really <unk> to eat.
Instead, look at the <unk> model.
That's what I was working on two billion years of experience about work.
<unk> in <unk>, <unk> like <unk> to <unk> and <unk> that are not <unk> <unk> <unk> in themselves to <unk> that are <unk> instead of <unk> to <unk> <unk> that are not just <unk> but experts but in relationships, because they're the ones that are also experts in <unk>.
If I need to be really <unk> to them are better than I've ever <unk>.
You know, it's okay, because if that's going to be the future of good food, it's going to be <unk>.
Thank you.
I grew up with a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>, an <unk> now and forth every day.
And I was always <unk> in a book, a book of <unk>, which <unk> my mind in other <unk>, and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, that <unk> sense of <unk> that I had.
And that <unk> was also in fact that every time I wasn't out in school, to <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, insects and <unk>, <unk>, insects and <unk> them to the <unk>.
I was a real <unk> of science.
But it always <unk> to try to understand the world, understand the <unk> of possible.
And my love for <unk> actually <unk> the world around me, because what was happening in the world around me, because what was happening in the <unk>, <unk> we were going on the <unk>, <unk> of the oceans, <unk> <unk> <unk> in our <unk> with its <unk> <unk> that <unk> us and places and a wonderful world that we had no way.
So, everything seemed to <unk> my passion for <unk>.
And I was an artist.
<unk> <unk>. <unk>.
And <unk> there were no <unk> and this <unk> of <unk> <unk> to the computer, and all these images in the <unk> of the media, I had to create these images in my head.
As a kid, when we <unk> a book, everyone <unk>, through the <unk> of <unk>, put something on our <unk>.
And so, my answer was <unk>, <unk> creatures, <unk> creatures, <unk> creatures, <unk> <unk>, all this stuff.
<unk> lessons always <unk> to <unk> behind the book.
That's because creativity had to find a <unk> way.
And it's <unk> an interesting thing: the <unk> programs <unk> <unk> me a lot for the fact that there was a <unk> world right here on Earth.
I would never go to a <unk> world on a <unk> <unk>.
It's very <unk>.
But that was a world where I could go to really, really, right here on the ground, the more <unk> and <unk> than what I could ever imagine these books.
So, I decided that I would become a <unk> at the age of 15.
And the only problem was that <unk> in a little country of <unk>, <unk> miles from the <unk> ocean.
But I didn't leave <unk>.
I <unk> my father until he found a school in <unk> school in <unk>, New York just spent just the <unk> <unk> from where I was.
And so I was able to take the <unk> into a <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk>, New York.
And I couldn't see the ocean, the real ocean, for other two years, until we <unk> in California.
<unk> then, over the last 40 years, I've <unk> about <unk> hours, and 500 of these hours in <unk>.
And I learned that the ocean <unk> of the ocean, even the <unk> oceans, are <unk> rich life that really goes beyond our imagination.
The imagination of nature is <unk> to our human imagination.
today, I'm <unk> by what I see when I do <unk>.
And my story of love with the ocean <unk>, <unk> than it has ever been.
But when I <unk> a career, from <unk>, I <unk> to make <unk>.
It has to be the best way to <unk> this <unk> to tell stories with <unk> to create images.
And, as a kid, <unk> <unk> and so forth.
So let's make film was the only way to put images and stories together.
All <unk>.
And of course, the stories I <unk> to tell was stories of <unk>: "<unk>," <unk> "and" The <unk>. "
And with "The <unk>" I <unk> my love for the <unk> and <unk> with a <unk> of a film.
So, I <unk> the two <unk>.
So from "The <unk>" came up with something interesting that was solve a <unk> <unk> problem in that film, which is creating the kind of <unk> of <unk> water. We have <unk> the <unk> with the computer.
And so the first <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> to the computer that was ever seen in a film.
And even though the film didn't have a lot of money, <unk> <unk>, I was <unk> of something extraordinary, all the public was <unk> by this <unk> <unk>.
You know, it's the law of <unk> that every <unk> technology is <unk> by <unk>.
You have to <unk> something <unk>.
And that <unk> me a lot.
And I thought, "<unk>, this is something that must be <unk> in <unk> art."
So, with "<unk> 2, my next film, we went a lot beyond.
<unk> with <unk> <unk> and <unk>, we created the guy's <unk> <unk> in that film. The success was <unk> <unk> by how that worked.
And it worked. And we had a <unk> again.
And we got the same <unk> with a public <unk>.
But we've <unk> a little bit more with that film.
So, <unk> a line between these two of experience, I came to the <unk> that this would be a new world, it was a new world of creativity for <unk> artists.
<unk>, I put a <unk> company with <unk> <unk>, my <unk> friend <unk> <unk>, who was the main <unk> and designers at that time, and we called <unk> <unk>.
And the principle of society was <unk> to <unk> the past, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on, and directly to the digital production.
And so we did and gave us a <unk> <unk> for a little bit.
But we came back to the '<unk> in the <unk> of creatures and <unk>, which is what we had <unk> society.
So, I wrote this text called "<unk> <unk>" with the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of <unk>, <unk> to the computer, with human <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the computer, and all the main <unk> <unk> to the computer and the whole world <unk>.
And this was <unk> to <unk>.
The kids in the society told me that we didn't have been able to do it for a little bit.
So, I <unk> it, and I did this movie of a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> it there as a "<unk> and <unk> on a <unk>."
We had been a story of <unk> love, a <unk> film.
<unk>, what I wanted to do was <unk> to see the <unk> of "<unk>."
That's why I did that film.
And that's the truth. I didn't know.
But I <unk> them. I said, "We're going to go to the <unk>.
We <unk> it for the beginning of the film.
It's very important. <unk> a <unk> of <unk> fantastic <unk>. "
And I <unk> them to <unk> a <unk>.
It looks <unk>. But this <unk> back to the imagination that creates the reality.
Because we really created a reality and six months later, I <unk> on a <unk> <unk> at two miles and <unk> <unk> in the North <unk>, looking at the real <unk> from a <unk>, not in a <unk> film, not in a <unk> movie, not in a <unk> movie, not in the <unk>.
I was <unk> <unk>.
And there's a lot of <unk>, we had to build <unk> and <unk> and a lot of other things.
But I was <unk> by those <unk> <unk>, it was like a <unk> mission.
where it was <unk> <unk> and <unk> huge <unk>.
You <unk> in this <unk>, you go down to this <unk> environment where there are no <unk> to be <unk>, where you can't go back from yourself.
And I thought, "<unk>. It's like living in a <unk> film.
That's great. "
And so, I was <unk> by the <unk> of the ocean.
Of course, the scientific <unk>.
It was all. It was <unk>.
It was <unk>. It was imagination.
And it was an experience that <unk> could not <unk> me.
Of course, I could imagine a <unk> and create a <unk> effect. But I couldn't imagine what I was out of the <unk>.
In our <unk> <unk>, I've seen creatures with <unk> <unk> and, sometimes, things that I had never seen before, things that nobody had ever seen before, which was actually not even <unk> by science at the time that we <unk> them and <unk>.
So I was all taken out of this, and I had to do more.
So I made a <unk> decision.
After the success of "<unk>," I said, "OK, I'm going to <unk> my <unk> job of <unk>, and I'm going to <unk> <unk> for a little bit."
So, we started <unk> these <unk>.
We went to the <unk> and <unk> with <unk> <unk>.
We came to the <unk> of <unk>.
We took little robots that we created with <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And the idea was to go inside and make a <unk> <unk>, which was never done.
No one ever looked inside of the <unk>. They didn't have the <unk> to do that, we've created technology to do that.
So there's a <unk> on the <unk>, sitting in a <unk>, <unk> the <unk> that <unk> just like these, where I knew that they had <unk> the <unk>.
And I'm <unk> a little <unk> <unk> through the <unk> of <unk>.
When I say that, I'm <unk> it, but my mind is <unk>.
It seemed to be <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>.
And it was the most <unk> experience that has ever lived, because I had ever <unk>, because before the <unk> corner, I knew what would have been behind, before the <unk> of the <unk>, because I had a <unk> for months to <unk> the film.
And the <unk> was based on a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
So it was an amazing experience.
And it really made me realize that in the experience of <unk> that you can <unk> these <unk> robots, the mind is <unk> in <unk>, in this other form of existence.
It was very profound.
And it could be a little <unk> of what could happen in some <unk> when you start to have <unk> for the <unk> or for other reasons that I can imagine, from the <unk> of <unk>.
So, we did these <unk>, and we actually started to <unk> what was there there, like the <unk> of the ocean <unk> where there were these <unk> animals.
<unk>, I'm <unk> right here on the ground.
We live in a <unk> environment.
We don't <unk> in a <unk> system <unk> as we do.
So, you see animals that live close to <unk> water to 500 degrees <unk>.
It's even impossible to <unk>.
At the same time I was <unk> to the <unk> science, again, it's the flu, as a kid.
And I ended up in the <unk> environment, really <unk> with the <unk>, sitting in the <unk> <unk> of <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and all of these things, to fly to the international <unk> with our 3D <unk>.
It was fascinating.
But what I ended up doing was to do was to bring scientists <unk> with us in <unk>.
And we <unk> down because they have access to <unk> <unk>, <unk> scientists, people are <unk> to these <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> down and <unk> them to see, <unk>, <unk> tools and so on.
So, we were <unk> of <unk>, but we actually <unk> science, <unk> science.
I had <unk> the <unk> between being <unk>, as a kid, doing those things really.
And you know, during this journey of discovery, I learned a lot.
I've learned a lot of science. But I also learned a lot of science.
They all think a <unk> to be a leader, the <unk> of <unk>, or something like that.
I knew nothing about <unk> before we do all those <unk>.
Because I had to say, "What am I had to do out here?
Why am I doing this? What do you know? "
You don't <unk> anything to do all these <unk>.
We go to <unk>. There's no <unk>.
People think about me who went between "<unk>" and "<unk>" and "<unk>" and "<unk>" and "<unk>" and "<unk>" and "<unk>" and "I <unk>" and "<unk>" and "<unk>" and "<unk>" and "<unk>" and "<unk>" and "<unk>" and "<unk>" and "and" <unk> "and" <unk> "and" <unk> "and" and "<unk>" and "<unk>" and "<unk>" and "<unk>" and "and" and "and" and "and" and "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk>
I did all these <unk> <unk>, all these <unk> for a <unk> public so <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, no money, no money. What am I doing?
I'm doing it for the task itself, for the challenge -- and the ocean is the most great challenge that I love, for the <unk> of discovery, and for the <unk> of the discovery, and for the <unk> of the <unk> team.
Because we <unk> everything with <unk> people, working together for years.
<unk> to <unk> months of <unk>.
And in that <unk>, you realize that the important thing is the respect that you have to them, when you <unk> a task a task that you can't explain anybody else.
When you <unk> to the ground, and he <unk>, "We had to do this, and the <unk> <unk>, and that, all of the technology, and the <unk> of the human <unk> when you work in the sea <unk>, the <unk> of human <unk> when you're working in the <unk> or the <unk> that have something together and know that they've never <unk>.
<unk> a <unk>, create a <unk> of respect.
When I'm <unk> to make my film, which is "<unk>" I tried to <unk> the same <unk> principle to <unk> the team and in <unk> <unk> <unk> their respect.
It's really <unk> <unk>.
And so I'm going to come here again with a small group, <unk> <unk> to make "<unk>" with new technologies we don't <unk> before.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>.
And we got a family, in the <unk> of four and a half years.
And it changed my own way.
People have <unk> and say that I took organisms from the ocean and I <unk> them on the planet <unk>.
For me, it was the <unk> of the way to do business, the process of itself, which was changed.
What can we <unk> then?
What are the lessons that we learned?
I think the first is <unk>.
It's the most powerful thing I love.
The imagination is a force that can actually <unk> a reality.
And the <unk> of the group is more important than all the <unk> of the world.
They come to me, and they say, "<unk> some <unk> to do this."
And I said, "We don't <unk>.
<unk> people <unk> it for you, you're not alone, not <unk> against yourself.
And <unk>. "
The <unk> is always saying this <unk>: "The <unk> is not <unk>."
But the <unk> must be a <unk> in art and <unk>, because it's how to make a <unk> in <unk>.
And no important <unk> that <unk> innovation was done without <unk>.
You have to be <unk> to <unk> these <unk>.
This is the thought I want to <unk> with, which is that in anything <unk>, the <unk> is a <unk>, but the fear is not. Thank you.
If you can imagine one great idea today, that the data set that <unk> is bigger than the <unk> of its parts, and that, instead of thinking about <unk> information, and that, instead of thinking about using information to <unk> new relationships so that we can see new relationships so that we can see new <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
So here you can see <unk> <unk> statistics.
So this device that I use is a little experiment.
It's called <unk>, and with <unk> I can choose to <unk> one cause of death, let's say <unk>.
And we see <unk> new relationships.
The reason is that here is that people are more <unk>; and here they're more <unk>.
We can take a step back and <unk> the data for death, we see that disease and cancer are the most <unk> <unk>, but not for everyone.
If we go on and <unk>, let's say under the 40, we see that the <unk> are the cause of death that I <unk> more.
It <unk> more <unk>, it's worth more than men.
So you've got <unk> information and data that's a little bit like <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> information.
What if we can do that with <unk> data, why not to do it with <unk>?
So for example, we have the <unk> of every <unk> ever <unk>.
That's it. All the <unk>.
You can <unk> it in your own <unk>, and you can also.
With <unk>, you can look at a <unk>.
Or a <unk> year.
You can <unk> a particular number in it.
For example, we take the <unk> that <unk> in this number, their <unk>.
I'm a <unk> of <unk> <unk>, so I'm going to <unk> here and I see all the numbers that I <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Now, if I want to <unk> a look at this, I could think, "Why don't we give a <unk> <unk>?"
Let's take a step back and <unk> the <unk>.
And now I see <unk> <unk>.
You're going to realize that when you look at the information in this way, <unk> or more from <unk> <unk>, and it's not just a research, it's not the <unk>.
But you do something different.
It's a <unk> way that <unk> us as <unk> to use information.
<unk> still this idea that may seem a little <unk>.
We took every single <unk> page, and we <unk> it to a short <unk> that <unk> in a small <unk> and a <unk> that <unk> the <unk> area.
I'll just show you the first 500 between the most <unk> on <unk>.
Even in this <unk> <unk>, we can do a lot.
They <unk> immediately like <unk> areas are the most <unk> on <unk>.
And at this point, the <unk> <unk>.
We can see this <unk> that the <unk> <unk> more often <unk> to this voice are the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
This is <unk> because it <unk> <unk> something that in the pages of <unk> <unk> wasn't there.
And you can just see it a step back to see this together.
If I <unk> one of these <unk>, I can then <unk> on the <unk> "<unk> of <unk> <unk>.
and <unk> everybody.
And at this point, I see that most <unk> from <unk> <unk>, some of science world.
Here's my <unk>.
One comes from the music.
And, what's interesting, <unk> has also <unk> a TED <unk>.
So let me see all the <unk> of the TED <unk>.
For the first time, we're actually <unk> the <unk> as if it was a network, not from page to a <unk> level.
I want to show you another thing that might <unk> you.
This is the site of New York <unk>.
<unk>, this <unk> -- I don't call it <unk>, because it's not a <unk>, but it's got to see pages -- we <unk> this technology for <unk> to the web, like this.
I can take a step back and go back and go back to a <unk> <unk>. This is important because only see the pages so that it makes me see all my <unk> in the Internet the same way.
I can <unk> on what I did in <unk> moments.
So here you see the state of the <unk> I just <unk>.
I can sort of <unk> more things I've seen in a day.
If I want to take a step back and see all I can <unk> my <unk> or <unk> my <unk>.
Here we <unk> <unk>, we <unk> the <unk> engine, here to <unk> <unk>.
And here I can <unk> on my web and just <unk> from here.
A <unk> <unk> many times, and in every case, the result is more than the <unk> of the parts, the data of <unk>.
<unk>, the world, the data is <unk> as a kind of <unk>.
It's about <unk> of information.
It's about <unk> in the data.
What if we <unk> everything <unk> if we <unk> the web instead of <unk> from one thing to the other, we'll allow us to go to a lot of other, and then you can see those structures that <unk> <unk> <unk>?
And then, instead of <unk>, we could actually <unk> information.
Instead of <unk> only information, we can <unk> out of knowledge.
And from knowledge maybe it comes to <unk>.
And with this <unk> you.
We all talk about happiness.
I asked to <unk> the number of books <unk> the word "happiness" in <unk> and <unk> over the last five years, they <unk> to <unk> 40, and there were many more <unk>.
There's a huge <unk> of interest about happiness, between researchers.
There's a lot of <unk> about happiness.
<unk> <unk> people.
But despite all this work flow of work, I've got a series of "<unk> <unk>" that somehow make <unk> ideas <unk> about happiness.
My talk about today is <unk> <unk> these "<unk> <unk>."
And it's <unk> people who think of their happiness, and it's about <unk> happiness, because it seems that we are <unk> as all other people.
The first of these <unk> is the <unk> to <unk> the complexity.
In fact, the word happiness is no longer a <unk> word for <unk> to <unk> fields.
I believe that you can <unk> at a particular meaning, but in a <unk> of <unk>, <unk> <unk> of this <unk> and <unk> <unk> the most <unk> vision of what the <unk> is.
The second <unk> is the <unk> between experience and memory: it's basically about <unk> between being happy in life and be happy about your life and be happy about your life.
And these are two very different <unk>, both part of the concept of happiness.
And the third is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that we can't think about any <unk> at all that we can't think of any <unk> at the <unk>.
I mean, it's a real <unk> <unk>.
and there's no way to do the right thing.
I'd like to start with an example of a person who, after a <unk> of questions and answers, after my lesson <unk> a story.
[<unk>...] <unk> <unk> that <unk> a <unk> of <unk> <unk> at the end of the <unk>, ♪ ♪ <unk> a <unk> sound <unk>.
And then <unk>, very <unk>, that he had <unk> the whole experience.
But it wasn't true.
What was <unk> was the memory of the experience.
He had lived the experience.
And it was <unk> for 20 minutes of <unk> music.
but this was not <unk> for nothing because he <unk> with a <unk>. The memory was <unk>, and the memory was <unk>, and I remember all the <unk>.
What this <unk> tells us, at the bottom, is that we could think about ourselves and other people in terms of two <unk> <unk>.
There's a <unk> that lives of experiences, which lives in the present and <unk> the present, and it's capable of <unk> the past, but it's only the present.
It's about "" self "and it lives" and what the doctor <unk> -- you know when the doctor asks, "<unk> <unk> you now, when the doctor <unk> here?"
And then there is the "self that <unk>," is the "<unk>" that <unk> the <unk>, "which is <unk> the <unk>, and <unk> of the story of our life, and that is that" doctor "<unk>", "How are you heard in the last time?"
or "<unk> <unk> your <unk> journey?" or something like that.
There are two different <unk>, the self that lives an experience and what if <unk>, and <unk> between the two is part of the <unk> of the <unk> of happiness.
The self <unk>, is a <unk>.
And this process begins with a fundamental answer of our <unk> -- it started immediately.
We're not just telling stories about <unk>.
Our memory tells stories, which is, what we have <unk> of our experiences is a story.
Let me start with an example.
It's an old study.
<unk> the experiences of two patients during a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I'm not interested in the details. It's not even more <unk> every day, but it was <unk> when this study was <unk> in the '<unk>.
They <unk> the patients to <unk> their pain every 60 seconds.
And here's the results for two patients.
They are their results.
If you say, "Who's got more <unk>?"
It's a very simple question.
<unk>, the <unk> <unk> more.
his <unk> <unk> <unk>, and for every minute to <unk> pain from the patient A A A A to <unk>.
But now there's another question: "<unk> these patients think they have <unk>?"
and here's the <unk>: <unk> A had a <unk> memory of the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
The stories of <unk> were different because one of the <unk> of <unk> is the way that we <unk> -- no of these are particularly <unk> -- but one of the two is particularly <unk> of the other.
And the <unk> is that where pain was <unk> at the final moment.
It's a <unk> story.
How do you <unk>?
Because we asked these people after <unk>, and even at a distance of time, "<unk> <unk> was the experience, everything <unk>?"
and a lot of <unk> <unk> for A to <unk>, in the memory.
So it's a <unk> conflict between the <unk> that lives experiences and the <unk> that <unk> them.
<unk> view of <unk> that lives the experience, is clear that <unk> has <unk> <unk>.
So, what you could do for the patient A A, and we've <unk> <unk> experiments, and it was actually done, and it works, you could <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> A <unk> the <unk> without <unk> too much.
This <unk> a little bit of pain in the patient, but just a little bit less than before.
And by doing this for a couple minutes, the <unk> that lives the experience of <unk> A <unk> A <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> that <unk> the experiences of <unk> A <unk> very much better, because now the <unk> A has got a little <unk> of his experience.
How do you <unk> a story?
And this is true for the stories that are from the <unk> that are <unk> for the stories that <unk> what <unk> a story, is the changes the <unk> and the <unk>.
The <unk> are very, very important and, in this case, the final one has <unk>.
So, the <unk> that lives experiences lives its life <unk>.
Is it <unk> experiences. And you know, what happens to you <unk>: What happens to these moments?
And the answer is simple.
I'm <unk> to say that most of the moments of our life -- as as I have them -- I mean the present present <unk> -- I mean the present <unk> is saying <unk> about three seconds. That means that in a life, about about <unk> million in one month, about <unk> million of the most of the <unk> that we're not <unk>.
Most of them are completely <unk> by the <unk> <unk>.
And <unk>, somehow you have the feeling that should be <unk>, that what happens in these moments of experience is our life.
It's the <unk> resources that we're <unk> as we're in this world.
And as a <unk>, <unk> <unk>, but it's not the story that the <unk> <unk> <unk> for us.
So we have a <unk> <unk> and a <unk> that lives experiences that are different.
The largest difference between the two is like <unk> the time <unk>.
<unk> view of the <unk> that lives experiences, if we <unk> in <unk>, and the second week is fun as much as the first, then the <unk> of two weeks is twice better than a week.
But this is not the way that the <unk> works is going to happen.
For the <unk> <unk>, a <unk> of two weeks is better than a week of <unk> because there are no new <unk> in <unk>.
You don't have changed the story.
And so, the time is the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> of experiences.
<unk> has an impact on this story.
<unk>, the <unk> <unk> experiences <unk> more than <unk> and tell stories.
It's actually the self that makes decisions, because, if you <unk> a patient who had, for example, two different <unk> with two different doctors and is <unk> what he <unk> is what he he <unk>. "
The <unk> that lives have no voice in these choices.
In fact, we don't <unk> between experiences, but among the <unk> of those experiences experiences.
And even when we think about our future, we don't think about our future as experiences.
<unk> to our future as <unk> <unk>.
<unk> you can look at this situation, as a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk>, and you can think about the <unk> that <unk> as if you <unk> the <unk> that lives experiences, not need.
I have a feeling that when we go to the case that we <unk> often <unk> the case that, <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And this is a little bit of <unk>.
<unk>, how much <unk> our <unk>?
This is one of the <unk> that comes up to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
When I think about that, I'm in my mind a <unk> of a few years ago, which is one of the best <unk> of my life, and what I think <unk> often, compared to the other <unk>.
And I've probably spent thinking about the <unk> of that journey of three weeks to say, 25 minutes in the last four years.
If I had ever open the <unk> with the <unk> of the journey, I would have <unk> another now. It's about three weeks of the journey that <unk> an hour and <unk>. It looks like there's a <unk>.
<unk>, I could be a little <unk>, in my <unk> <unk> for <unk> consumption, but even if you're going to <unk> more than that, a <unk> question.
Why we give the memory of weight than the weight we give experiences experiences?
Now, I want you to <unk> to an experiment with the thought.
Imagine that during the <unk> <unk> <unk> that at the end of <unk> all the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and that <unk> a medicine to the <unk> <unk> <unk> nothing.
<unk> the same <unk>? And if you had to choose a <unk> <unk>, you create conflict between the two <unk> and you have to think of how to solve this conflict and it's not so <unk> because, if you think about it in terms of time, you have a answer.
And if you think in terms of <unk>, you could get another answer.
The <unk> because we <unk> the <unk> that we do, is a problem that <unk> us with the two <unk>.
The two <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> actually two <unk> of <unk> that we can use, one for every <unk>.
So you can ask: What is happy the <unk> that makes the experience?
And then you can ask: What are the moments in the <unk> life that lives?
And it's about <unk> happiness for times times it's a <unk> process.
What are the emotions that we can measure?
And, by the way, now we're able to do a good idea of <unk> happiness which lives over time.
If you know about the happiness of the <unk> <unk>, it's a completely different thing.
It's not about how <unk> a <unk> person.
It's about how <unk> or <unk> is the person when he thinks of her life.
It's a very <unk> idea.
They're not able to <unk> these two <unk>, they're not going to make <unk> <unk> in the studies of happiness, and I'm going to a group of <unk> students, who have <unk> the studies of happiness for a long time exactly this way.
The difference between the <unk> happiness that <unk> the <unk> experiences and the <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> has been <unk> over the last few years, and they're now <unk> to measure the two <unk>, the <unk> <unk> has a <unk> <unk> on what they think about their lives and their experiences.
And there were other studies in this direction.
So in the last few years, we started <unk> about happiness of two <unk>.
And the biggest lesson we've learned, is that they're very different.
You might know how a person is <unk> with your life, and then this is not telling you very much about how <unk> <unk> your life and <unk>.
To give you an idea of <unk>, the <unk> is about <unk>.
What does it mean that if you <unk> someone, and you would say, "Oh, his father and <unk> <unk> <unk>, how much <unk> of his <unk>?
Well, <unk> something about his <unk>, but with a lot of <unk>.
<unk> always a little bit of <unk>.
If I tell you that somebody thinks that his life is at eight at a <unk> <unk> from one to 10 to very <unk> <unk> about how much happy they are with their <unk> that live the experiences.
So <unk> is low.
We have a certain knowledge of what the <unk> of the <unk> happy.
We know that money is very important, the <unk> are very important.
We know that being happy to be <unk> with the people who <unk> us, we spend time with people <unk>.
There are some other <unk>, but these are the main ones.
So if you want to <unk> the happiness of two <unk>, you're doing very different things.
The <unk> of what I said is that we shouldn't think of happiness as a <unk> <unk>.
It's about two completely different ideas.
In more, very quickly, another reason that we can't think <unk> to happiness is that we don't pay attention to the same thing when we think about life.
<unk>, if you make the simple question of how happy people in California, we don't get the <unk> answer.
When you look at this question, you think you're <unk> to be <unk> in California, <unk>.
What happens is that when you think about life in California, you're thinking about <unk> between California and other places, and for example, that <unk> is about climate.
<unk>, <unk> that climate is not so important for the <unk> that live in experiences and it's not very important to the <unk> <unk> that <unk> is what you know, how much happy people are.
But <unk> the <unk> that <unk> is in <unk>, you might end -- some people might, at the end, <unk> in California.
And it's interesting, what's interesting to the people who <unk> in California hope to be <unk>.
<unk>, the <unk> that lives have no longer <unk>.
We know it.
But one thing is <unk>. <unk> to be more happy, because when you think about it, it was how <unk> it was time.
And I tried to <unk> the right decision.
It's very difficult to think about the <unk> and I think I'm going to <unk> the idea of how hard it is.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have a question for you.
Thank you very much.
When we were at the phone phone a couple of weeks ago, it <unk> me that an interesting result that was <unk> by the <unk> of <unk>.
Is it something that thinks we could share that we still have a few minutes?
<unk> <unk>: <unk>.
I think the most interesting <unk> that we found in the <unk> <unk> is a number, which is not going to be able to find.
We found that, with <unk> at the <unk> of the <unk> that lives.
When we <unk> like <unk> <unk> with the income, we found that, under a <unk> <unk> per year, for the Americans, on a <unk> study on a <unk> study on a very <unk> <unk> of about <unk> Americans, it's about a <unk> <unk>, it's about a <unk> <unk> dollars a <unk> <unk> per year --
CA: <unk> <unk>: <unk> <unk> dollars a year, people are <unk>, and they become more <unk> as they become <unk>.
I mean, I've seen <unk> of the lines so <unk>.
<unk>, what happens is that money doesn't <unk> the happiness of the experience, but the lack of <unk> <unk>, and we can measure that very, very clearly.
In the other <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, is another story.
More money, you're <unk>, you're <unk>.
This talk is not about emotions.
CA: But <unk>, all the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> life, freedom, the research of happiness.
If people <unk> <unk> this discovery, which is basically <unk> everything we've been <unk>, for example, political about <unk> and so on.
<unk> the possibility of <unk>, and the country in general, can take a discovery like that <unk> and bring a public policy on <unk>?
<unk>: <unk> I think that <unk> the role of happiness in public policy.
The <unk> of <unk> is going to be <unk> in the United States is not <unk>, but in <unk> <unk>, is becoming reality, and in other states.
People are <unk> to recognize that should think happiness when they think about public policy.
It's a little bit and the people tend to <unk> if they want to study the experience of happiness or if they want to study the <unk> of life that we need to start this <unk> to the most soon.
As you <unk> the <unk>, it takes different <unk> to how you <unk>, and <unk> you <unk> to the <unk> that you <unk> or the <unk> that makes the experiences experiences.
All of this <unk> policy, I think, in the years.
In the United States, they're doing <unk> to measure the population of happiness.
And this, I think, I'm going to be part of the next <unk>, maybe, of the <unk> statistics.
CA: <unk>, it seems to me that this is going to be, or for less interesting policy to follow in the next few years.
Thank you very much for taking the <unk> economy.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about energy and climate today.
It may seem <unk>, because in my work at <unk> <unk> me to <unk> and <unk>, things from <unk> and give the world to help the two billion <unk> people to live better lives.
But climate and energy, actually, are extremely important for these people, <unk>, are more important to them than anyone else in the world.
A climate is, for many years, <unk> loss.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, or too <unk>.
<unk> in ways that their <unk> simply can't <unk>.
That <unk> to <unk>. <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk>, they'll be for them <unk>.
Even the cost of energy is, for them, important.
In fact, if you <unk> the price of one thing, to reduce poverty, <unk> of energy.
The energy price is <unk> over time.
And a <unk> civilization from the progress of <unk>.
The <unk> revolution has <unk> that <unk>.
And even in the <unk> century, we <unk> at a <unk> <unk> in the price of electricity, which <unk> because we have <unk>, we can create materials and make a lot of things.
In the <unk> world, so, we are for the electricity in a <unk> situation.
But while the <unk> price, for example of half, we have to <unk> a new <unk>, the <unk> of <unk> emissions.
<unk> is <unk> the planet, and its <unk> is very simple.
<unk> <unk> causes an increase of temperature, which <unk> very <unk> effects.
<unk> on climate and <unk>, maybe even worse, in the sense that the natural <unk> can't <unk> to these <unk> changes and <unk>.
The <unk> of how much it <unk> the temperature cause of a <unk> increase of <unk>, and as <unk> of two things <unk> the other, it's <unk>, but not very much.
And there's <unk> <unk> on how much they're going to be <unk>, but it will be extremely <unk>.
So I often asked the best scientists: Can we really reduce <unk> emissions to zero?
<unk>'t we only can <unk> at half or a <unk>?
And the answer is that, until it comes to zero, the <unk> temperature to <unk>.
It's a great challenge, so.
It's not like to say, "You've got a <unk> <unk> <unk> under a <unk> <unk>."
It's not about "<unk> a little bit."
It's about <unk> <unk>.
Now, we <unk> a lot of <unk> every year, over <unk> billion <unk>.
<unk> 20 <unk> for each American.
For <unk> countries, it's less than a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The average world is about five <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And somehow, we need to do <unk> that <unk> amount of zero.
The emissions are <unk>.
Just some economic change this <unk> changed this <unk>, so we have to move from <unk> to <unk> to zero.
This <unk> has four factors.
It's a series of <unk>.
We have the <unk> on the left, the <unk> <unk>, which <unk> to be <unk>, and the factors on the right population, the services that on average every person uses, the <unk> energy <unk>.
<unk> <unk> and we see how we can <unk>.
<unk>, one of these numbers need to <unk> almost zero.
It's <unk> <unk>.
Let's see a little bit.
The first <unk> is the population.
The world has <unk> <unk> billion <unk>.
We <unk> to the <unk> billion.
If we do a good job with new <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> health, we can <unk> it maybe 10, 15 percent <unk>.
The second <unk> is the services we use.
That <unk> everything, the food that <unk>, <unk>, TV, <unk>, <unk>.
It's <unk>, and <unk> of poverty is about <unk> these services for almost everyone in the world.
And it's a <unk> thing that this <unk> number.
In the <unk> world, in the <unk> billion <unk>, we might be able to <unk> and use less, but on average, every year, this number <unk>.
And so, <unk>, the amount of services is going to be more than <unk>.
This is a very simple example of service.
You have the <unk> in your house, to make <unk>, but these guys are no, so <unk> and <unk> their <unk> under the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> to the <unk> -- and the energy for <unk> <unk> <unk> -- finally there's good news.
This <unk> is not <unk>.
Thank you very much <unk>, new ways of <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, for a lot of services you can <unk> the energy <unk>.
In some services, you can reduce 90 percent.
There are other services, like <unk>, or the <unk> <unk>, where the <unk> are very, very, very <unk>.
So, <unk>, in the best of the cases, the energy <unk> <unk> by three to six times.
But these first three factors <unk> emissions from <unk> to <unk>, in the best of the cases, maybe 13 billion <unk>.
It's not enough.
<unk> the <unk> <unk>, the key <unk>, the amount of <unk> <unk> for <unk> energy.
The question is, can we <unk> to zero?
If you <unk> <unk>, no.
If you <unk> gas, it's not.
We <unk> all the ways to produce <unk> today, <unk> <unk> and nuclear, <unk>.
So what we're going to do on global scale, so it's create a new system.
And we need <unk> <unk>.
<unk> term "<unk>," I don't mean something impossible.
<unk> is a <unk>. The computer is a <unk>.
The Internet, and its services, I'm a <unk>.
People here today have <unk> to the creation of many <unk>.
We don't usually have a <unk>, a <unk> by <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, it's got to the window and something else is not.
In this case, we have to drive all the speed, and make a very <unk> in a very <unk> time.
I asked myself, how do you do this concept?
Is there some natural example, some <unk> that <unk> the imagination of the people?
I <unk> at a year ago, when I <unk> <unk>, and people <unk> it fun.
We <unk> them in the world, there are people who <unk> with <unk>.
But this is my idea for energy.
I decided that <unk> would have been <unk> this year my <unk> to the environment.
Here are <unk>.
They're not <unk>, they're not going to get out of the <unk>.
-- now, we can <unk> <unk> like this, but they're not going to help.
We need solutions, one or so many of them, which is, <unk> on a large scale and very <unk>, and <unk> is <unk> in many <unk>, I think that only five <unk> five <unk> effects.
I <unk> the <unk>, <unk>, nuclear <unk>, <unk>.
I'm also going to give a few <unk>, and if they can do more than that, but here I'm interested in <unk> that I'm going to work on <unk> of these five, and I can't <unk> to any, because it's all hard challenges.
<unk> for the first <unk> of <unk>, <unk> or <unk> gas than it is.
So here our task seems simple, but it's not, and it's <unk> <unk>, and it's <unk> <unk>, after <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> by some <unk>, and we <unk> it.
Today, there are <unk> technologies that <unk> 60 -- 80 percent of <unk>, but <unk> to 100 percent will be very <unk> and it's going to be hard, and it's going to be hard, and it's going to be <unk> on.
The most <unk> is still the <unk>.
Who <unk>?
Who do something that is literally billions of times more <unk> than any kind of <unk> <unk>, how nuclear <unk> or whatever?
It's a huge <unk>.
So it's a <unk> problem.
Another source would be nuclear.
But nuclear <unk> <unk> three big problems.
The cost, especially in countries very <unk>, is <unk>.
The security of security, the <unk> <unk> that nothing can go, <unk> <unk> is <unk> by human <unk>, and that the <unk> doesn't <unk> <unk> for <unk>.
And how then <unk> <unk>?
<unk> the amount, the <unk> are many.
People need to be <unk>.
So it's very difficult problems, so that you could solve, and what you should work.
The <unk> three of the five <unk> I <unk> them.
These are the people who are often <unk>.
And to say, real, <unk> the great <unk> of not <unk> a <unk>, <unk> some <unk>.
The first is that the <unk> of energy <unk> with these technologies is <unk> <unk> to the power of <unk>.
It's about "energy" <unk>, "and therefore a lot of <unk> kilometers, of thousands of times <unk> than a normal electric.
And also these <unk> are <unk>.
The sun doesn't <unk> all day, <unk> every day, and it's even the wind <unk>.
<unk>, if you depends on these <unk>, you need to find a way of <unk> energy even when the source is not <unk>.
<unk> challenges us <unk> on the front of the cost.
And on <unk>.
For example, let's say that this <unk> source is at <unk>.
So not only need to be the technology, but you've also got to <unk> with the <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
And finally, the problem of <unk>.
For <unk> the size of the problem, I've <unk> all kinds of <unk> <unk> today, for cars, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, of all kinds, I have <unk> with the amount of electric energy <unk> in the world, and I found that all the <unk> now in production could make less than 10 minutes of that energy.
So we really need a big step forward, a <unk> of 100 times as <unk> to <unk> now.
That's not impossible, but it's not very simple.
This problem is already when the <unk> "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk> ", 20 or 30 percent of the energy <unk>.
If you <unk> to those <unk> for 100 percent, we need a <unk> "<unk>."
But how do you <unk> on this street? What is the right approach?
Is it a <unk> <unk>? What might solve the problem?
A lot of companies, at hundreds, they have to take a lot of companies.
We need at least percent in each one of these five <unk>.
Many of them, <unk>, <unk> them. Which is good.
And I think that here, in the TED group, many people were already working on these fields.
Bill <unk> has different companies, including a <unk> called <unk> <unk> technologies.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> in <unk> of companies that are doing great things, and they have interesting, and I'm <unk> my support to all this.
<unk> <unk> and I are <unk> a company that, <unk> you <unk>, <unk> the nuclear road.
There were some <unk> in <unk>, nuclear nuclear <unk>, <unk>.
But as a good time, the sector is <unk>, that there are some good ideas around is not so amazing ideas.
The idea of <unk> is that, instead of <unk> just part of the <unk>, the <unk>, the one percent of the available available, we decided to <unk> the <unk>, <unk> percent.
For the truth, if you talk about it for a long time, but it's never been <unk> if it would work or not, just because of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> today you can do a <unk> and see that yes, with the <unk> materials, it looks like <unk>.
And <unk> <unk> percent of the <unk> percent of the <unk>, the <unk> costs <unk>.
They <unk> the <unk>, and they use as they <unk> the <unk> of today, which became, a <unk> <unk>.
You <unk> the <unk> as the <unk> <unk>. It's a kind of <unk>.
It's like a <unk> of <unk> <unk>. It's called <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> the problem is <unk>.
Here's a picture of a place in <unk>.
This is the <unk>, <unk> percent of the <unk>, which has been <unk> the part of now <unk> as <unk>, and so it's called <unk> <unk>.
These <unk> <unk> energy to the United States for <unk>.
And <unk> the sea water, with an economic process, there would be enough <unk> for the rest of the life of this planet.
So there's a lot of challenges, but this is an example of hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need for <unk>.
How should we measure our progress?
What should the <unk>?
<unk> the goal, and then <unk> the steps <unk>.
You know, you've heard a lot of people of 80 percent for <unk>, it's very important to <unk>.
20 percent will be produced by <unk> countries, and from some agriculture.
And at that point, we'll have <unk> the <unk> and <unk> production.
To get to 80 percent, so, <unk> countries, <unk> countries like China, will have to <unk> their own production.
The other question is, are we <unk> this technology?
Do we <unk> it basically in <unk> countries?
Is we also <unk> it?
It's a <unk> <unk>.
It's a key <unk> of <unk>.
Can you look at <unk>, what should have the <unk> of the <unk>?
<unk> that should have the same two <unk>.
We had <unk> <unk> to start <unk> to start <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, <unk> will be a total amount of <unk>, and so the temperature.
But the <unk> in this matter, doing things that don't have great <unk>, has a <unk>, or <unk> <unk> <unk>, to the other, which is the speed of innovation of new <unk>.
We need to <unk> these <unk> at all all these <unk> at speed, and we can measure the speed of companies, <unk> <unk>.
A lot of <unk> books have been <unk> about it.
The <unk> <unk>'s book, "The choice" and the David <unk>, "<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>."
These books <unk> the problem and create a context in which we <unk> the <unk> because these things <unk> of a <unk> <unk>.
A lot of things need to <unk>.
So I have a wish.
A lot of <unk> <unk> technology.
If you had to choose one only wish for the next 50 years, in: you could choose the <unk> of the country in the country, the <unk> of a <unk>, which is going to be able to get <unk>, or do this last.
<unk> that with more impact.
If this wish is not <unk>, the <unk> between those billion people will be <unk> and those people who are <unk>, between the United States and China, between <unk> and <unk>, it's going to be <unk>, and most of the <unk> of the two billion people will be very long <unk>.
So what do we need to do?
What am I going to give you the <unk> and <unk>?
We need more <unk> to research.
When countries <unk> in places like <unk>, they don't have to talk about <unk>.
You can also <unk> the <unk> program, and I'm going to tell you about how <unk> <unk> <unk> in these <unk> <unk>.
We need <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, the "<unk> and <unk>, the tools that <unk> the cost of <unk>.
We need to <unk> the message.
We need to make this more <unk> and <unk>, and it must <unk> the choices of government.
It's a <unk> wish, but I <unk>.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. <unk> for <unk> on <unk>, here --
first of all, can you <unk> an idea of the size of the <unk>?
Bill <unk>: <unk> the software, we <unk> the <unk>, <unk> all the great scientists, which we already did, requires only <unk> of millions, and even when we have <unk> the materials into a <unk> <unk>, to make sure that we were <unk> to <unk>, just hundreds of millions.
The hard thing is to build the <unk> <unk>, find <unk> billion, the <unk> <unk>, the place where we had built the first <unk>.
Once built the first, if it works like <unk>, it's going to be the <unk> of <unk>, because the cost, the <unk> of energy that we know today.
CA: So if you look at all, this <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>, of a <unk> <unk> full of nuclear <unk>, <unk> of this kind of <unk> <unk>.
Then the process begins from high and <unk> to the <unk>?
<unk>: Right. <unk>, <unk> today, are <unk> <unk>, many people, many people who can not work, <unk> <unk>, things that <unk> and <unk> --
That's not good.
If the <unk> is very <unk> and you can <unk> it for 60 years, <unk> inside and <unk> all those complexity.
<unk> there, <unk> for <unk> years, and then <unk>.
CA: A nuclear <unk> <unk> that <unk> itself.
<unk>: Yeah. Well, the <unk> you can leave them there, then you can take it in another <unk> and <unk>.
And <unk> with <unk> already <unk>, now <unk> in <unk> of <unk> or <unk> <unk> to the <unk>.
We <unk> our first <unk>.
So what was a problem with <unk> <unk> is going to be the <unk> of our <unk>, and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, as soon as this process is going to be reality.
CA: But when you go around the world of the potential of this technology, where most interest to its <unk>?
<unk>: Well, there's no place in particular place, and there are all these interesting rules of <unk> on everything that is nuclear, so I'm very <unk> interest.
Our <unk> was in <unk>, India, China.
I just met the <unk> for <unk>.
We talked about how this idea is <unk> to the current program.
They're <unk>. <unk> and <unk> did the work in this field.
It's a <unk> of something that was done.
It's a <unk> <unk>, but it's a kind of <unk> <unk>, which many countries have already built, so everyone has built a quick <unk> is a good <unk> to <unk> our.
CA: <unk> your <unk>, what are the time and the <unk> that something like this <unk> <unk>?
<unk>: Well, for one of these projects at the whole, which is <unk> energy, which is not very much, we talk about 20 years to <unk> and 20 to <unk>.
This is the <unk> that <unk> models could be <unk>.
<unk>, if everything <unk> well, that's not <unk>, it could easily <unk> this goal.
And now there are, <unk>, <unk> of companies in the sector, which <unk>, if <unk> <unk> for their <unk> <unk> will be <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
And it's better if a lot of solutions are going to be, because at that point you're <unk> to a whole set of solutions.
It's necessary that at least one has happened.
CA: <unk> of <unk> important, <unk>, this is the largest <unk> you <unk>?
<unk>: A revolution <unk> is the most important thing.
It would be even without <unk> <unk>, but the <unk> <unk> really make much more important.
In nuclear <unk>, there are other <unk>.
We don't know their job well as this, but one is nuclear "<unk>, a different approach.
There's a <unk> <unk>. It seems to me to make, but maybe they say the same thing.
So, there are different, but the nice is that a <unk> of <unk> <unk> a million times more energy than a million times more energy than a <unk> of, say, <unk>, so if you start to <unk> the <unk>, the potential, in terms of effects on the environment and another, it's almost a <unk> class of <unk>.
CA: And if it doesn't work, what do we do?
We shouldn't have to start <unk> <unk> to try and <unk> to keep the <unk> temperature <unk>?
<unk>: If you look at that situation, it's a little bit like when you <unk> too, and you're going to have a <unk> <unk>.
Where do you <unk> at that? You need to have a <unk> or something like that.
There's a whole line of research on <unk> <unk>, which are <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> 20 or 30 years which <unk> the action.
It's like <unk> <unk>.
<unk> we don't need.
Some people say you don't even have to work at <unk> because you're <unk>, you're going to continue to eat so much.
I don't think it's a <unk> choice, but now in the <unk> of the problem, but now in the <unk> of <unk> asks us if we want to keep solutions in the case that the <unk> events, or the <unk> <unk> later of the <unk>.
CA: <unk>: If I had a <unk> or two to <unk> them, like <unk> <unk> <unk> who have <unk>?
<unk>: Well, <unk> there are different types of <unk> and those that <unk> <unk> <unk> are very few.
Some people say that there's a <unk> <unk> because of the <unk> that <unk> the effects of <unk>.
I'm very, very, very few things that you can only say that there is a <unk> of a million <unk> <unk> up here.
We have a <unk> <unk> now and <unk> the consequences just a lot later.
And so, when you're <unk> by a thousand <unk>, the idea of <unk> which <unk> the results only...
<unk> for <unk> <unk>.
In fact, the relationship of <unk> is not going to <unk> the case <unk>; there's people in the <unk> world looking at the <unk> and says, okay, that's not that bad.
The fact is that that <unk> should take action.
But my dream is that, if we can <unk> <unk>, and <unk> the <unk> on the <unk>, then the <unk> <unk>: Okay, it doesn't matter if we <unk>, almost <unk>, but we <unk> it's more <unk> than <unk>, but the <unk> is more <unk> than <unk> technologies.
CA: <unk> your answer to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>, that if you <unk> all the <unk> <unk> <unk> trying to solve the problem of <unk>, your <unk>, your <unk>, when there are things to do, is it it's going to be <unk> resources in a <unk> way?
<unk>: Well, the <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> --
We say that <unk> should have <unk> 10 billion more than <unk> now is not so <unk>.
It should not <unk> resources to <unk>.
Now, the things that <unk> a lot of money, and also here people might <unk>, are the <unk> to <unk> solutions.
For me, it's <unk>.
<unk> you are not <unk> the <unk> of learning, <unk> at the point where you're going to be very <unk>, I think <unk> <unk> <unk> in technologies that have the potential to <unk> the cost.
If the <unk> was, "<unk> the <unk> energy, so that only only the rich can be <unk>," all the people in the <unk> to pay the energy that's five times <unk>.
The <unk> would be for those billion.
And <unk> <unk> his <unk>.
<unk> <unk> now is, why don't you get more than <unk> and <unk>? "
For her past, it still <unk> between the "<unk>," but he realized that it's a pretty <unk> group, and so it's <unk> the question of <unk> and <unk>.
And it's a question that I think is <unk> <unk>.
It's amazing how little little little <unk> <unk> in <unk> and development.
CA: Well Bill, I think, really talk to the name <unk> <unk> of the audience saying that I hope you see your <unk> to be reality. Thank you.
<unk>: Thank you.
I'd like to share with you a discovery that I did a few months ago when I was <unk> an article for the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I always <unk> my <unk> <unk> to my <unk> to <unk> every time I <unk> something, but I had <unk> <unk> the paper, and I realized I never in my life <unk> the word "<unk>" to see what I'd found.
Let me give you a result.
"<unk>," <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>, <unk>.
And I was <unk> this list at a friend and at the start <unk>, it was so <unk>, but just <unk> the word <unk> my voice was so <unk>, and I had to <unk> out of the <unk> and impact the <unk> of these words that they left me.
You know, we're talking about the <unk> of an old <unk>.
I'm thinking, it's going to be a <unk> <unk>, right.
But, in fact, the <unk> of <unk> was 80 years old.
when I was <unk> my <unk>, and I was <unk> and <unk> what I was <unk> out of my family and <unk> things to other children and the world around me.
and, <unk> <unk>, thank God, I wasn't using the <unk> of <unk> at the time.
I mean, from this <unk> seems that I'm <unk> in a world that someone like me who has nothing to do for them in any way for them, when, actually, in fact, when, actually, are <unk> for the opportunities and <unk> that my life has <unk>.
So, I immediately went up to see the <unk> <unk> in the network, I try to find a <unk> without value.
This is the <unk> version of <unk>.
<unk>, it's not much better.
I find the two words under "<unk>" particularly <unk> <unk>, "whole" and "<unk>." So, it's not just <unk> the words.
that's what we believe people when we <unk> them with these words.
It's about the values behind these words, and how we <unk> these values.
Our language <unk> our world's thinking and our vision of the world and how we see other people.
In fact, a lot of <unk> <unk>, <unk> that <unk>, <unk> <unk> was more powerful, because saying things at high voice.
So, what do we want to bring to <unk>, a person that's <unk>, or a person with <unk>?
So, we were doing something simple as a person, a kid, a child, we could <unk> some <unk> and <unk> <unk> on their own force.
Don't you have to open <unk> for them?
So one person, who <unk> me, was the <unk> doctor, was the <unk> doctor in <unk>, <unk>.
His name is <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, the name, <unk>, was too hard to <unk> for most Americans, so it became <unk> <unk>.
And the <unk> <unk> always <unk> <unk> and had a <unk> <unk> to work with children.
<unk> anything about the time that I spent in the hospital, with the <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
I had to do what we call <unk> <unk> <unk> with these <unk> <unk> <unk>, in different colors, you know, to help build the legs.
And I <unk> these <unk> more than anything.
I <unk> them, really <unk> them.
And, you know, I already knew <unk>, as one of five years, with the <unk> <unk> to try to <unk> from these <unk>, <unk>, clear.
And one day, one of my <unk> <unk> and <unk>, these <unk>.
And he said, "<unk>, <unk>, you're a little girl, so strong, I think you can see one of those <unk>.
"When the <unk>, you'll be 100 dollars."
Now, of course, it was just a little <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> that I didn't want to do in front <unk>, but, what I did, it was to give a different shape to a different shape to a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
and <unk> in an interesting experience for me.
And I'm <unk> today, the <unk> of his vision, and of her <unk> about me as a child, has <unk> my vision of myself in a strong, <unk> and <unk> to the future.
This is an example of how adults with <unk> of power can <unk> the force of a child.
But, in the example of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>, our language doesn't have the <unk> of <unk> to the reality that everybody <unk>, the chance of a <unk> of seeing itself as <unk>.
Our language is not <unk> to step with changes in our society, many of which were <unk> by <unk>.
of course, from a <unk> perspective, my legs, my legs, the <unk> to the <unk> of <unk>, <unk> and even <unk> bodies to <unk> them.
So, maybe the technology is going to be <unk> now more clearly than the one has been a truth, that each one has something <unk> and <unk> to our own society, and the human ability to <unk> is our largest quality.
The human ability to <unk>, is something interesting, because people have always wanted to <unk> to <unk> them, and I have to tell you that.
And this <unk> wasn't right, and I've been <unk> to <unk> in the answer to this, and I think I'm trying to understand why.
it's <unk> in this <unk>, <unk> <unk>, is the idea that success, or happiness, is <unk> on the other side of a challenge without <unk> or <unk> of this experience, if my success in life has come from a ability to <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of a life with <unk>, or what people <unk> like my <unk>.
But in fact, we're <unk>, we're <unk>, <unk>, from a challenge, <unk> or <unk>.
And I <unk> <unk> that's a good thing.
The <unk> is not a <unk> that we have to <unk> our life.
It's part of our life.
And I tend to think it's like my <unk>.
<unk> it a lot of times, and sometimes almost nothing, but it's always with me.
And, of course, we're not <unk> to <unk> the impact, the <unk> of a person.
There are the <unk> and challenges in life, and it's all true and <unk> to every single person, but the question is not if you <unk> <unk> or not, but how the <unk> to <unk>.
So, our responsibility is not simply to protect people to us from the <unk>, but <unk> <unk> in the right way.
And we make a <unk> to our children when we make them feel that they're not interested in <unk>.
There's an important and <unk> between the fact that <unk> <unk> <unk> to be a <unk> person and the <unk> <unk> of the society that <unk> me or not.
And, actually, the only <unk> <unk> that I had to face is whether the world has thought I could be <unk> by those words.
In our <unk> to protect those who <unk> <unk> a <unk>, <unk> <unk> about their <unk> <unk>, or, really, the <unk> of their <unk> of life, we have to make sure that we don't have the first <unk> in a wall that made someone.
Maybe the <unk> model of just looking at what there's <unk> in you and how to <unk> it, it can <unk> more the <unk> than the disease itself.
In not <unk> one person in <unk>, we don't understand its <unk>, we're creating another disease that have.
We're actually <unk> a <unk> to the value of a person in our community.
So we have to see through the disease and the <unk> of human ability.
and more importantly, there's a relationship between those <unk> <unk> and our <unk> creativity.
So, it's not about <unk>, or <unk>, these <unk> research as something that we want to <unk> or <unk> under the <unk>, but rather find those opportunities in a <unk>.
So, maybe the idea that I want to explain to you is that there's no thing as a <unk> <unk>, as <unk> to <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, to use a term of <unk> struggle, maybe even <unk> together.
And maybe, if you look at a <unk> as a <unk> and <unk>, we're less <unk> by his <unk>.
<unk> year, the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>, and it was <unk> years ago, when I <unk> about evolution, which <unk> has <unk>, I think, the truth of the <unk> to the human <unk>.
To <unk> it in another way, it's not the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, and it's not even the most <unk>, it's more <unk>.
The conflict is the <unk> of <unk>.
We work with <unk>, among other things, we can recognize that the human ability to survive and <unk> is <unk> by the <unk> of the human <unk> through the <unk> in <unk>.
So, again, <unk>, is our largest quality.
And perhaps, <unk> we are not <unk> to <unk>, we don't know what we're <unk>.
Maybe this is what <unk> gives us, a sense of <unk>, a sense of <unk>.
So we can make a <unk>.
We can, we <unk> the <unk> as something more than <unk> period.
Maybe we can see it as a <unk>.
The <unk> is a <unk> that we haven't <unk> yet.
I think the largest <unk> <unk> that we've <unk> is this idea of <unk>. Now, who's normal?
There's no normal. There is a common <unk>, there's a <unk>. There's no <unk>.
And <unk> <unk> those <unk> people <unk> if they <unk>?
I don't believe that.
If you look at this <unk> from one of how to get the <unk> to one of the <unk>, or <unk>, to be <unk> a little bit more <unk>, we can understand the force of so many children, and they tend to <unk> their <unk> with the community.
<unk> <unk> us that what we, as humans, we have, as humans, we've always wanted to help us.
There's a <unk> that in <unk>, 60 years ago, <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> with <unk> <unk>, and, maybe thanks to the experience and the <unk> of these people were <unk> the value of the community: We didn't know people like <unk> or <unk> <unk>; they were <unk> as <unk> and <unk>.
A few years ago, I was in a <unk> <unk> market where I grew up in the <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
and I was <unk> in front of a <unk> <unk>.
It was summer and I had <unk> <unk>.
I heard this guy, his voice behind me said, "but, it's not <unk> <unk>." And I got <unk>, and there's this man from <unk>. I had no idea who he was.
And I said, "<unk>, <unk>, we <unk>? I don't remember <unk> me ever <unk>," He said, "but, you're not going to meet with you.
I mean, when we <unk> you were <unk> from your mother's <unk>. "
Oh, that guy.
And, but of course, in fact, I <unk> a <unk>.
And that <unk> was the <unk> <unk>, a man that I had only met with the stories of my mother on that day, because, <unk>, <unk>, I'm <unk> in <unk> of two weeks.
And so, the <unk> <unk> of my mother had gone to <unk>, so the man who made me <unk> was a <unk> <unk> for my parents.
And, <unk> came up without the <unk>, and I had my <unk> <unk>, some <unk> in this <unk>, and some in that, he had to be the <unk>, this <unk> had to <unk> the bad news.
And he said, "I had to give this <unk> to your parents who never <unk>, and that you never had the kind of <unk> that have other children or any kind of <unk> life, and you've given me of the <unk> since then," <unk> <unk>. "And you have to <unk> during my whole <unk>, which I had a <unk> <unk> <unk> during my <unk>, which I had a <unk> between all my <unk>.
I had <unk> with the <unk> <unk>, you know, the <unk> of <unk>, which I had <unk> my <unk> <unk>, and all my <unk> <unk>, and <unk> them, <unk>, <unk> to the students of his course, <unk> school school school.
And it's called this part of the course of the course of the human <unk>.
<unk> <unk> can keep <unk> on how much it can be and how <unk> it can be and how <unk> is in the quality of the life of a person.
And the <unk> <unk> came to <unk>, and he said, "In my experience, to less than <unk> said, and even if it's <unk> a <unk> of support, if it's just left to the same, a child comes to us."
So you see, the <unk> <unk> changed its <unk>.
He understood that there is a difference between a <unk> <unk> and what each one can do with <unk>.
And there was a change in my thinking during the time, in this, if you asked me when I was 15 years old, if I had <unk> <unk> with my legs and <unk> I would not <unk> a second.
<unk> that kind of <unk> at that time.
If I love me today, I'm not sure.
And it's because of the experiences I had with them, not to <unk> of experiences that I had with them.
and, maybe the change in me is <unk> because I was <unk> because I was <unk> more to the people who <unk> me.
You can see, everything you need is a person that <unk> you <unk> the <unk> of your <unk>, and you're <unk>. If you can give someone the <unk> of their <unk>, the human is so <unk>, if you can do it and open open a door, you're <unk> it in the best of the ways.
You're <unk> them to <unk> themselves.
In fact, the <unk> meaning of the word <unk> comes from "<unk>" which means, <unk> out what is inside, to bring to the potential.
So again, what's the potential we want to <unk> out?
There was a case study in the '<unk> in <unk> <unk>, when they were <unk> by <unk> schools to <unk>.
It's called the <unk> <unk>.
It's about <unk> <unk> students.
And the students with the best <unk> program, and better <unk> program, and better, <unk>, <unk>, they did it for a period of three months, <unk> students with <unk> <unk> gave the "<unk> they said they were good.
And at the end of this period of three months, they were <unk> at the level of "<unk>." And, clearly, the <unk> <unk> of this study, and that they took of the students from "<unk>," they said they were <unk>. "And that's what happened at the end of the three months.
They were <unk> to school, <unk> to the ones that I had left.
The <unk> part of this study was that the teachers were <unk>.
The teachers didn't know that it was done this change.
And it was simply like this: These are the students from <unk> and these are the ones with <unk>.
And so it's how they started <unk>.
So, I think the real <unk> is to have a <unk> <unk>, and a <unk> <unk> doesn't have hope.
It doesn't see the beauty.
It has no longer our natural, <unk> <unk> and our <unk> to imagine.
But if, we can <unk> the human <unk> to keep the hope, to see the beauty in itself and others, to be <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk> we're using our <unk> force.
When <unk> these quality, we can create new reality and new ways to be.
I'd like to leave you with a poem by a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> called <unk> <unk> that made me know my friend <unk> <unk>.
and the poem is called "The <unk> that <unk> only four words," Every child has met God, not the <unk> of the <unk>, not the <unk> of the <unk>, but the God that's only <unk> four words and <unk>, saying, <unk> with me <unk> with me.
Thank you.

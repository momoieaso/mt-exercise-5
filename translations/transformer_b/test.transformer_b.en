Parech years ago, here at TED Peter Skillman introduced a challenge of design called the marshmallow challenge.
And the idea is very simple.
Grupps of four people have to build the highest possible that you're putting 20 spaghes, using 20 spaghes, a tape of slow and a marshmallow.
The marshmallow needs to be square in the top.
And even though it looks very simple, in fact, it's pretty difficult, because people to cooperate very quickly.
So I thought it was an interesting idea, and I've realized it in a lab.
And it was a huge successful.
And since then, I've organized about 70 laborators of this guy around the world with students, designers and architects, and architects, even the directors of Fortune 50.
There's something in this exercise that's important lessons about the nature of collaboration, and I'd like to share some of these lessons with you.
Normally, most of the people are starting with orienting to the task.
They're talking about it, you know, they're going to have, and then they're planning time, organizing.
They're skets and predict the spaghetti.
They're going to rate the most of the time assembling spaghets in growing structures and, at the end, right when the time it's to fall out the marshmallow, and caught it's taking a step back and Ta-da!
They mire their work.
But what's really going on, most of the time is that the "Ta-da Ta-da," it turns into a "Uh-oh," because the weight of the marshmallow shmallow shmallow and collapsing the whole structure.
There's a number of people who have a lot more times. "uh-oh," others, and among the worst of business school.
They cheat, they cheat, they're shooting, and they create structures.
And there are of course groups that have a lot more structures, "and, in the best, there's the best neodiploms of schools.
And it's amazing.
As Peter says, they don't just create the highest structures, but they're also the more interesting structures.
And your question is going to be: How do it? Why is it?
And Peter love to say, "No one of the kids spent time trying to become the SpA director." Just. "
They weren't spend time, they don't.
But there's another reason.
And the reason is that the students are formed to find the single best project.
And then it.
And after, what's going on is that when they put the marshmallow, don't have time, and what happens?
The crisis.
Do you play? Right.
What the children are doing, it's starting from marshmallow, and they build prototypes, and they build prototype, they're always keeping the marshmallow, they're going to be prototyping types.
The designers recognize that this kind of collaboration is the essence of iterative process.
And with any version, the children have an instantaneous feedback on what works and what it works.
So the ability to work on prototypes is essential, but let's see how they work different groups.
The average for most people are about 50 centries, for the students, for the students, about half the students, about half, lawyer, a little better, but not much, children, better than a lot of adults.
Who makes all better?
Architects and engineers, thank you.
99 cm is the highest structure that I've ever seen.
And why? Because they understand that triangles and the geometric models are the key to build stable structures.
Then we have the general directors, a little bit better.
But here's where it's interesting.
If you include a loministrator, the group can do much better.
It's incredible. It's a little bit around, you'd look at that that group "You're able to understand in anticipation. And why?
Because they've got particular skets.
They get the process, they understand it.
And all the groups that are running and they're carefully attention to work.
You've got special across, and their combination brings to a safe successful.
If you've got 10 groups who usually work well, you're going to get structures that's in the feet.
And I've tried an experiment.
I thought, let's stay for one time.
I've put to 10,000 dollars of premise software in software.
What do you think that's successful students?
What's the result?
That's what happened.
No one of team created a stable structure.
If one of them had built a 2.5 cm, it's taken house.
It's not interesting that an impact so strong?
We've tried again with the same students.
What do you think this happened?
Now, they realized the value of a prototype.
The same team, from worst has become the best.
They created the highest structure in the minor time.
So they're important lessons about the nature of incentives and successful lessons and successful lessons?
The reason is this: aid to create digital tools and processes to help groups build, video games and visual effects.
And what a challenge challenge is to help to identify the hidden assumptions.
Because, honestly, every project has his marshmallow, isn't it?
The challenge provides a shared experience, a common language, a common position to build a prototype.
And so, this is the value of experience, of this simple exercise.
And those of you who were interested in, it can go to marshmallower.
It's a blog where you can give a look at how to build marshmallow.
There's steps for step.
There's a crazy examples from all over the world of how people are correct and cool the system.
There's also the world record.
And the most important lesson, I think, is that design is really a sports of contact.
It requires the employment of all the senses, and the use of the most winds, feelings and the manuality and manuality to manuality the challenge that you have in the hand.
And sometimes, a small prototype of this experience is all it's necessary to transform a moment.
And it can do really make a difference.
Thank you very much.
Let's make a car, a big, great, beautiful, in the TED style, it's a car of time.
Everybody in this room.
You can go back, you can go forward; you can't remain where you're.
And I'd be curious to know what choose, because I asked it to my friends in the last times, and everybody want to go back.
I don't know. They don't know, there were cars or Twitter, or "American Idol."
I don't know.
They're convinced that there's a kind of return to the image.
I understand it.
But I don't do part of that group, I have to admit it.
I don't want to go back, and it's not because the possibilities on this planet doesn't go back.
So I want to go to the car and I want to go on.
That's the best period that there's been on this planet in every field that we can measure: health, wealth of disease.
There's never been a period like this.
My grandchildren's die, everybody's 60 years.
My grandborn that number to 70.
My parents are to touch 80.
So it's better that there's a nine to the number of my years.
But it's not only about people like us, it's a much larger thing.
A child was born in New Delhi can expect to live so much as the riest man in the world of 100 years ago.
Think about it. It's an incredible fact.
How does it be true?
Let's killed a billion people on this planet.
He changed the demography of the global as no war has done.
If you go.
We disconfitted it. Puff.
In the rich, disease that threatened millions of people only one generation does not exist, in practice.
Diftherefore, rosoly, polio --
someone knows what they're?
Vaccines, modern medicine, our ability to nutrition people, these are triumps of scientific method.
And according to me, the scientific method, trying to see if they don't work, it's one of the great results of humanity.
These were the good news.
Unfortunately, it was the only good news because there are other problems, and they've got a lot of times, for example one of them is that, despite everything that we got, despite everything we've gone on this planet, every day.
This number is growing, with incredible rapidity, and it's shame.
And we didn't only used our creativity to fill the planet.
We've been able, growing growing, pluvial forests, oil, natural gas: They're disappearing, and they're disappearing, and if we don't innor our actions to get us.
So the question is, we can do it? I think yes.
I think it's clear that's possible to make food to feed billions of people who live.
I think it's possible to reforest this world of energy without that this destroy.
I think it's really, and no, it's not an illusion.
But here's the thing that's shoots me at the night.
We've never needed so we needed scientific progress, and we've never been in the position of using them to the best of how we could we do today.
We're at an incredibly step events, really, in many.
But despite this, I think we should go back to the centuries, 300 years before Illuminism, to find a period where we combat the progress, a period where we combat them, a period where we've combat them.
People are trapping in what they believe, and they do it with a lot of strength that we couldn't liberate them.
It's also liberate them.
Listen, everybody's right to their opinion; they also right to their opinion progress, but you know what you don't right?
You can't right to your facts. I'm sorry, you can't.
I put it a little bit to understand it.
One decades ago, I wrote a story about vaccines for "The New Yorker," a short article.
And I was amazing that someone opped, that it's contrary to what is, after everything, the most effective public health.
I didn't know what to do, so I had written the story, and I've spent the story, and I've spent.
I don't have been written a story about genetically modified.
It's just bigger.
People were crazy.
So I wrote a story about that, and I couldn't understand why people consider the OGM's "food's" because they thought that move the molecules so specific, instead of house, instead of nature.
But as always, I do my work. I wrote the story and I went on.
I mean, I'm a journalist, let's go down, let's go out there.
But these stories, and I couldn't understand why, but I finally got it.
The problem was that those fanatic fanatics who were making me patic weren't fanatic.
They were people of consciousness, educated people.
They were exactly like people in this room.
And the thing was disorder --
But then I thought, we have to be honest; we're at a point, on this planet, where we don't have the same relationship to progress that there was once.
We're talking about environment.
We're talking in terms, using virgols, "Progress," I'm okay, there are some reasons to do it, and I think we know what are.
We have lost trust in institutions, in authorities, and sometimes in science, and it's understandable that it's success.
You just do some names and people understand.
Chernobyl, Bhopal, the Challenger, Vioxx, Vioxx, weapons of mass destruction.
I mean, each one has his list.
We have questions and problems with the people we thought we had always been right.
So you're skeptical.
You're asking answers, you're pretend to answers.
You don't say anything for me.
But here's the fundamental thing: when the evidence is necessary to accept them, and we're not very good at this.
And I think the reason is that we find us in an epidemic of fear I'd never seen and hopefully I'd never seen.
About 12 years ago, a story, a horrible story, which sustained there was a legame between an epidemic epidemic of autism and vaccinately.
It's very scared.
Hundreds of studies were done to see if it was true.
And they had to do hundreds of studies; it's a important question.
They got the data.
They came from the United States, the England, from the Sweden, Canada, and everyone was equal, no correlationship, no correlationship, nothing.
It didn't make difference. It doesn't do it because we think about what we're seeing to see, what makes us feel real.
We don't believe a pile of documents that show us numbers, and I understand it, I think we all understand it.
But you know what?
The results were devastating --
It's a fact: the United States are one of the few countries in the world in which the number of vaccines in the world the number of vaccine.
It's horrible, and we should shame us.
It's terrible.
What happened to us to do something like this?
Now, I understand it.
Think about it, do you think about it?
Anyone of the audience has ever seen a person die?
It doesn't happen.
In this country doesn't happen, but it happened 160,000 times in the world.
I'm a little bit of death for death, 20 every time.
But since it doesn't successful here, we can take them out of head, and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around shooot messages like Oprah or Larry King Live.
And they can do it because they don't understand the difference between causality and correlation.
They don't understand that those two things seem, but they're not almost never.
But it's something we need to learn it, and we need to learn it.
This man has been a here, Jonas Salk.
He's libered the humanity from one of his worse.
No fear, no suffering -- no suffering.
The man at the center, it doesn't as much.
It's called Paul Offit.
It's simply created a vaccine against the stuff together.
She saved 400, 500 children every year in the developing world.
It's bad, right?
It's great, if it wasn't Paul goes to talk about vaccines, says how they're precious and people should just stop.
And he says in these terms.
So Paul is considered a terrorist.
When Paul talks in a public heudience can't test can't test.
They're called her house because he's like to remind him.
Why? Because Paul created a vaccine.
I wouldn't need to tell it, but vaccines are fundamental.
If we stop taking them, the diseases return, disease, terrible disease, and it's happening.
We've got the disease in this country.
And it's going to be worse, and I'm not very children will die again, because it's just a question of numbers.
And they're going to die.
Let's do that. Let's take that. Why not?
My colleague of my colleague, he wrote a few weeks ago, and he told me that I would consider a little bit.
No one told me.
She wouldn't vaccinated her son.
No even death.
OK.
Why? Because there's not us. But you know something?
We didn't have polio in the United States.
Today, I don't know -- maybe stery a guy on an airplane in Lagos and it's coming to Lagos Angeles, now it's over the Ohio.
Maybe it's going to land between a couple of hours, it's going to read a car here in Long Beach and stashed to one of these fantastic organized by TED.
He didn't know they've been infected by paralyzed disease, and we don't even know why it's how the world works.
That's the planet that we live. We don't do it.
We're going to draw us to go. We're doing it.
However, the vitamines morning?
Echinain, a bit of antioxydant to start the day.
I know you did this because half of Americans it every day.
They take that stuff, how they deal medicine alternative medicine, and it doesn't matter how often they're useful.
It's always demonstrate it.
They make urine, they don't do, almost ever.
But it's good, you're going to spend 28 billion dollars, I'm with you!
Urine, I'm.
Why do we do that?
I think we're going to understand, we're the big houses.
Let's the big government machine. We don't trust us.
And we do well. Our health care system ago.
It's cruel to millions of people.
It's absolutely, incredibly cold and demoralizing for those of us who can allow it.
So let's go away, and since who we refugee?
We're runs of the big placebo.
It's fantastic. We love the big placebo.
You know, it's a serious problem because this stuff is a schief, and we spend billion dollars.
I've got a series of examples here.
No one of these -- knee, I'm knee -- a sraws, acades -- I don't even know what it's there's a skin.
You know one thing? When I'm saying these things, the people, I'm saying, and they say, "But what's interested in.
It's good. "
Well, guess what? You're going to go.
Because I don't care if it's the Department for the Salute and the Uhm, I don't mean "Uhm, I don't intention the mammography" or whether it's a few cancer that wants to curate the patients.
When we imbock the street that lead to replace science and evidence, we end in a place where we don't want to be.
Let's start as Thabo Mbeki in South Africa.
It's killed 400 meates of his citizens, citizens and it's going to work better than drugs drugs that we know they can slope the decord of AIDS.
Hundreds of thousands of deaths in one countries in one countries that's been column from this disease.
Please, you don't come to tell me that there are no consequences for these actions.
There are always.
Now, the most stupidemic epidemic that we're in the middle of the genetically food sustainers of genetically modified and food.
It's an idiom. It has to end.
It's a diatriba on on the metaphor.
It's ideology, it's not science.
Every single thing that we eat, every chick of rise, every skets, every prices of Bruxelles has been modified by humans.
You see, there were no matter in Eden Eden.
There were no melting.
There were no Natal trees. We created them.
We did it in the last 111,000 years.
Something has worked and something else.
And we've eliminated what he didn't work.
Now we can do it more precise.
And there's some risks, of course there are.
But we can put things like vitamin the recognize. A in the rise, and this would help millions of people, dealing their life.
And we don't want to do that?
I have to tell you, I don't understand it.
We're against OGM.
Why?
The things that I'm always feeling is, too much chemical compounds, hormonoultures, we don't want camps with the same thing, it's wrong.
We don't want the companies of life.
We don't want that companies are unique property.
You know what my answer to this?
It's yes. You're doing something. We do something.
It's true, we have a huge problem, but it's not science.
It has nothing to do with science.
It's law, morality, morality, morality lines.
You know that science is not a corporation.
It's not a nation.
It's no idea; it's a process.
It's a process, sometimes of positive, sometimes no, but the idea that we shouldn't be allowing science to do his work just because we're fear is really very, very clear to try.
You know, in the next 50 years we're going to be forced to produce 70 percent of food in more than we produce now, 70 percent.
These are the investments in the last 30 years.
She's going to see.
They don't need them.
Why? It's genetically modified.
We don't want to encourage people to eat, for example.
I'm billion people are eating.
It's a little bit of a path.
But it's just calculate. It's slave.
It doesn't have nutrients, it doesn't have proteins, but scientists are finding the way.
So a lot of people may eat less risk and run the risk of become blind.
They won't die, and you know one thing?
It would be very nice. It wouldn't be a lush restaurant.
I'm just asking myself: why are we against?
I mean, let's ask it, let's do this thing?
Only why we don't want to move genes and there?
It's about genes. It's not about chemicals.
It's not about our ridiculous obsession for hormones, or our desire to have bigger food, better.
There's no Rice Krispies.
It's about saving people, and it's now starting to understand what it means.
Why -- do you know? -- if we don't understand it, and we're going to continue to behavior, we're going to be hit, we're going to be making, technological colonialism.
There's no other way to describe what's going on.
It's selfish, it's horrible, it's in front of us, and we have to stop it.
So, after this fun conversation, you could ask me, "You want to go into this ridiculous," You want to go to the future? "
Of course! I'm going to.
It's stuck on the present now, but we have an amazing opportunity.
We can move the time as we want.
We've got the chance to go where we want, and we're going to do.
We need to do this conversations, and we need to think, but when we enter in the car of time and we're going to be happy to do it.
I know that we can and, as I think that the world needed to me.
Thank you.
Thank you.
One day, the Los Angeles Times Steve Los Angeles Steve Lopez's center for the streets of Los Angeles when she felt a beautiful music.
Essa came from a man, a man, an American, fascinating fascinating, with the marches, without deman, and he playing a violin that he had only two cords.
I'm telling a story that many of you know, because the articles of Steve serious, because the articles of a book, which, followed up to the big screen, with Robert Downey Jr who interpretated the part of the Steve Lopez, and Jamie Foxie Foxy, and Jamie Foxix in the Nathony Ayers, the contrabasic contrabasis.
Nathaniel left Juilliard, he had a terrible exhathaniel, and 30 years later she was going to live as a without the streets of Skid Row in the center of Los Angeles.
I'm going to read the book of Steve or looking at the movie to understand not just the beautiful that created between these two men,
My name is Jane McGonigal. I'm an author of video games.
I realized games from 10 years and my obbious for the next 10 years and my objective for the next ten is to try to make the easy to save the world in the real life in the real life in the real life in the real life of online.
To do that I have a plan, and it's in convince, incing all of you, to spend more time playing games and interesting.
I spend three billion hours a week playing online.
Some of you might think, "It's a beautiful time playing."
maybe too long, considering how many urgent problems we need to solve in the real world.
In fact, according to my research, Istitute for the Futo, it's true.
Three billion hours, they're not allowly sufficient to solve the most urgent problems in the world.
In fact, I believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet, we need to increase remarkably that.
I calculated that the total we need is 21 billion hours of game every week.
It's probably a moment, it's probably a repeat, so the repeat, to release the concept.
If we want to solve problems that hunger, the poverty, the poverty, global climate change, the global conflicts, I believe that we need to have the environment to play online, at least 21 billion hours, for at least 21 billion hours at the end of the next decades. No, they, they're really.
That's why. This image reassume because I think that play is so important for the survival of human species. It's true.
This is a picture of the photographer Phil, he wanted to capture the emotion of play.
So he's photographed of playing.
And that's an emotion classic.
If you're not toy players is possible that you're some of the smotherates of this picture.
You can probably notice the sense of urgency, a little bit of fear, but also an intense concentration, a very deep attention in the facting to deep in facting with a very difficult problem.
If you'll notice, you'll notice some details around the eyes, and around the mouth are a sign of optimism.
And they're surprised them shows surprise.
That's a step at a step from one thing called an "Epica."
Ah, it's a term you've heard. Okay.
So we have a game players between us.
One evidence is an extraordinarily positive result that you don't seem as possible to when you don't get it.
It's almost beyond the imagination, and when it's a shock discover what you're really capable.
This player is a step from a step.
And that's the expression we need to see on the face of millions of results in the world while we face the obstacles in the world's expression of someone that, against all the expectations, it's at a step.
Unfortunately, that's the expression that we're seeing to deal with urgents.
This is the expression that I call "I'm Brave Nella Realty." And I'm Br. "
I'm with expression, "I'd Nella Realty."
This is a deal in my old neighborhood of Berkeley, California, where I did the PhD, where I did the PhD on why we're more good in the game.
And that's a problem of many players, we feel that we're not good as well as a game.
And I don't mean, "simply as successful" as success "even though successful, we get more results on online monds.
But I mean, I mean, "in the sense of motivated to do something important, inspired to collaborate and cooperating.
And when we're in a world online world, I believe that many of us become the best versions of themselves, the most capable of focus on a problem to focus on a problem for all the time, of realing up after a failure after a failure and try new.
And in the real life, when we faced a failure, when we faced a hostacle, often's often's often's not feel like this: We feel depressed, maybe depressing, frustrated or fish.
We're never feelings while we're juggling in a game.
So this is what I wanted to study about university.
What's in a game us feel that we don't get any result?
How can we transporting those feelings from games and apply them to the real world?
So I've studied games like World of Warraft, which is really the ideal environment to solve problems in collaborative way.
And I began to notice some things that make the victories so possible in online monds.
The first is that when you appears in one of these online games, especially in World of Warcraft, there's lots of different characters that are trust a mission to save you a mission to save the world.
But it doesn't any mission, any perfectly adequate your level in the game. Right?
So you can complete.
They never give you an impossible challenge.
But it's the limits. So you've got to try.
But there's no disoccupation in World of Warcraft, you don't spend time at the time, there's always something specific and important to do.
And there's a lot of collaborators.
Everywhere, hundreds of thousands of people, you're ready to join you to join your mission.
It's not something so common in the real life, this feeling our disposition, there's a lot of collaborators.
And there's also this narrative, this narrative, this narrative that inspired, because we're there, and what we're doing.
And then we get all this positive feedback --
You've heard about increasing level of level and a strength.
We don't make that kind of feedback in real life.
When I leave this stage, I wouldn't have a public talking about a audience, and he's in a bizarre.
I didn't real that kind of feedback in real life.
Now, the problem of collaborative environments like World of Warcraft is that it's so much satisfaction is that it's so much satisfy to be a step from a game to play all our time in these play worlds.
It's just better than reality.
It's because now, now, at all World of World of World of Warraft has spent 5.93 million years to solve the virtual problems of Azeroh.
This is not necessarily something negative.
But put it in perspective: 5.93 million years ago, it was the period that one of our ancestors got up.
That was the first primate to walk.
Okay, so when we're talking about how we're investing in playing, the only sense of thinking about it, it's talking about times about human evolution, which is an amazing thing, but also useful, because we've discovered that we're going to change what we're all this time playing, we're changing what we're going to be human, we're evolving.
This is true, I think about it.
That's interesting this statistics.
It's been published by a researcher to university Carnagie Mellon.
The young medium today in a country today in a country with a strong culture of players, it's going to spend 10,000 hours playing online, at the age of 21.
10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons.
First of all, for the children in the United States 1080 hours is the exact number of hours that steps up to the maturity if you're all the day.
So we've got an entire course of parallel in which the young people learn how it's good players ♪ talks about time at the school learning in the school learning at the time.
And some of you're probably read the new book of Malcolm Gladwell, "Fuorclass."
If you've done it's successful, the 10,000 hours for the success.
It's founded on a great research in the cognition in cognition that if we dedicated 10,000 hours of fruit to any of 21 years, we're going to be genes in that camp.
We're going to look at that so much as the best people in the world.
So what we have now now now, what we have now is a whole generation of young people who are genes of play.
So, the question is, "Exactly, what do they become good these players?"
because if we could understand what it's about what's about a amount of human resources.
That's the number of people in the world who spend at least an hour a day to play online.
These are our genes of play.
500 million people who are extraordinarily -- in something.
And in the next decade, we're going to have another billion players that are amazing in that something.
If you didn't know it, this is what we expect: the video industry is developing platform is developing platforms that consuming energy and work with the net cell instead of the Internet to be cell, particularly in India, China, particular, in India, China, in India, Brazil, can connect.
The estimate is a billion players in the next decade.
It's going to bring us to 1.5 billion players.
So I started thinking under what these games are transforming us into genes us.
These are four aspects I've expected. The first is an optimism.
Okay. I think about it as an extreme form.
A optimism is the desire to acting immediately to deal with a obstacle, together with the convincation of success.
The habitual players believes always believe that this is possible and it's possible and it's going to try to try, and try to try to try and try to do it now.
The habits doesn't have hands in the hands.
The habitual players are virtuos in the text of a social trama.
There's a lot of interesting research that shows how we find better with other people after playing with them, even though they've done.
And the reason is that it takes a lot of confidence to play with someone: We have trust that they're going to do their time with us, that they're going to do with the same rules, and they're going to conclusion of the game.
So, playing together in fact, it's constructed the legs of trust and cooperation.
With that we have really more social relationship.
Productivity. I love. I love.
You know, there's a reason for the World of World of Warcraft is 22 hours a week, almost as a part-time work.
It's because we know, as we're playing, that we're really happy, we're able to release it or losing time.
We know that we're optimized, as humans, to work with something that meaning.
And the game players are willing to work constantly, if he's assigned a task.
It's to end, an epic meaning.
The players love to be associated to be associated with wonderful missions, humans on the planet.
For example, a little information to help create a context.
You all know Wikipedia, the largest wiki in the world.
The second largest wiki in the world, with almost 80,000 articles is the World of Warcraft of Warcraft.
They have more information about World of World of Warcraft in the Internet, which whatever argument in any other wikers in the world.
They're building an epic opera.
They're building a source of information about World of Warcraft.
Okay, these are the four superpowers that together something only.
The habitual players are the big optimism of super-powerful optimism.
These are people who believe to be individually capable to change the world.
The only problem is that they believe they're able to change virtual worlds, but not real.
This is the problem I'm trying to solve.
There's a economy named Edward Castronova.
His studies are brilliant. She's studying why people invest so long, energy and money, energy in online monds.
And he says, "We're looking at what's constitutes nothing less that a mass exodd to virtuals and play online environments."
And it's a rational, so it's rational, and he says, I'm exuberant --
But he's safe -- he's a perfectly sensed, because abits players can get more in online worlds that in life.
They can have more solid social relationship in a game that not in real life.
They have a better feedback and they feel more reward in a game that they don't in real life.
So, he says, for now, it's perfectly reasonable to play more time in virtual worlds Ancial world, I agreed that this is reasonable, for now, but it's not, in any way, there's no way, an ideal situation. We need to start making the real world's similar to a game.
This is inspiration from something that happened 2500 years ago.
These are ancient states, made of pectures of bones that we had bones and cleaned bones, we had bone bones, and these represent the first tools by humanity.
If you know the written of the ancient historical written, maybe you know this story.
It's the story of who invented games and why.
I've been narrow that games, particularly invented in the realm of the Lidia, during a period of heart.
It turns out to be so several, that the Lidia decided to do something impensive.
People's suffer, the population was in recently, they needed an extreme solution.
So, according, they're invent, they'd games and they're a valid law for all.
One day, everybody would eat.
The next day, everybody would play.
And they became so deeply in the games of from the time that playing is so involvent, and it's involvent, and it's in a manufacturing state of productivity.
And so one day they'd been playing.
And in Eroom, they're so 18 years, survived to the carest one day and playing this following.
I think that's exactly the way we use games a day.
We use games to go to the suffering of the real world.
We use games for them all that we don't work in our real environment, from everything that doesn't work in our real environment, and we get what we need games from games.
But we don't have to stop here.
That's really interesting: second Eroductation, after 18 years, the carestia didn't speak, so the decided they'd playing a last game.
They became the whole rules of half, playing a game from the winners, and the winners of that participate participate to an adventure.
They left the Lidia and went in search of a new land where to live, left behind the right number of people to survive with the resources to survive with the resources, with hope to bring their civilization somewhere else.
It's a bit bizarre, right?
Recently though, studies on DNA revealed that the Etruss that they would then brought to the empire, they share the same DNA of the Lidia.
So Recently, scientists have suggested that the story narrange is a true story.
And geologiologists, they've been evidence for almost 20 years and that might explain.
So this amazing story might be true: they could actually save their own culture playing their culture playing, refugees in games for 18 years to be so inspired, and knowing so well as well as I came to save so well how to come to save so the whole civilization.
Okay, we can do it.
We're looking at World of Warcraft from 1994.
It's the first strategy of World of World of World of World. This 16 years ago.
They play from 18 years, we've playing Warcraft for 16 years.
I say, we're ready for our game.
They had half the population to the research of a new world.
It's since 21 billion hours of hours of game at the week.
Let's do half of us agree to spend an hour a day to play, until we don't solve the problems.
I imagine what you're going to ask, "How do we solve the problems of the real world in a game?" Well, that's what I've dedicated my work during the Future.
In our offices of Palo Alto, we have this standard that express our idea of how we should be relationship with the future.
We don't want to predict the future.
What we want to do is -- the future.
We want to imagine scene from the best results and then we want to give them the chance to the people to transform them.
We want to imagine victories to realize them.
I'm going to show you briefly three games I'm an attempt to give people the tools to create victories in their future.
That's "Mondo."
We made this game in 2007.
It's an online game in which you're trying to survive to a oil.
It's not real, but we published enough, but we published online material is, and to live life as if we were dry. So, when you enter in the game, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, in the areas, and the dopodiches we realize the cost of the oil, the things that aren't available, the impact on the distribution of food, the impact on the distribution of food,
the transportation of transportation, if you're closed, if you've got to think about how you'd you've got to think about how you'd you have a blog about, to publish, to publish, to public video, to publish, to publish, to public video, to publish, to publish, to public video --
We had this game with 1,700 players in 2007 players in 2007, and we looked at them for the next three years, and what I can tell you is that it's an experience.
No one wants to change the way that only live because it's a good thing for the world or because it's a good thing for the world.
But if you're immerged them in an adventure and say, "We don't have oil.
That's an amazing story. It's an adventure.
It's travel to see how survive. "
Most of our players has learned the habits who learned in the game.
So, at the next game face, we decided to save the world, we decided to put higher, at a larger problem of oil.
We made a game called the Superstruct, Istitute for Futo, and the premise was: a supercomputer has calculated that humanity has only another 23 years on this planet.
The supercomputer is called "Sistema of the Global Estination." Of course. "Of course." Obviously. "
We've asked people to reach us online almost like a Jerry Bruckimer.
You know the movies of Jerry Bry Bruckheimer, form a team from dream: There's the astronauta, scientist, the galem, and they all have something to do to save the world, but in our game, instead of having five people in the team, instead of having five people's dream from dream, and it's moved with the future of the energy of the food, the future of resources, the future of health and the future of social safety.
8,000 people played for eight weeks, they've generated 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can find if you go online and look at Google. "
To finally, the last game, I'm going to start the march. That's a game with the World Bank.
If I took the game, you're going to be certified from the World Bank, as Social Bank.
We're working with universities for sub-Saharan Africa, we're inviting them to learn social innovation.
There's a story, you've got level of level thanks for the local knowledge, collaboration, sustainability, the imagination and inventive.
I invite all of you to share this game with the young, everywhere in the world, particularly in the developing areas in the developing areas of developing, which they could make benefit from the world.
It's time.
I want to ask a question.
What do you think it's going to happen?
We've all these amazing players, we have these games that are pilot of the projects of what we could do, but no one of these has saved the world.
Well, I hope that you're agree with me that players are a human resources that we can use to do for work in the real world, that the games are a powerful platform for change, that we have these incredible superpowers, a joist productivity, a game productimism and the desire of an optimism, optimism and the desire of an optimism.
I'm really hopefully that we'd meeting us to play games that have important to survive on this planet for another century, and my hopefully is that you're joined to realize and participating with games.
When I look forward at the next decade, two things are sure: that we can make any future, we can make any future, we can imagine, and that we can play any game.
So, I say, let's start with games that will change the world.
Thank you.
For some time, I've been interested in the placebo effect, it's like a strange whether you don't consider from my point of view that I don't look at the point to become something real. "In other words, the sugar effect in some studies, the sugar effect in some studies, just because the person's thinking.
that's happening to a drug or something like that --
The therapia of pain, for example, if they believe they're going to have a measurable effect in placebo.
Something of fake is true to something true for the perceception that.
To understand us, I'm going to show you a very simple magic, very simple.
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick that's in all the books for children's years.
I've learned it alone with Cub Scout Magic in the years.
I'm going to explain this.
And so I'm going to explain why I'm explained it.
That's what happens.
The knight, you can look at my hand, you can examine.
I'm just going to stop the knife, like this.
I'm typics.
To be safe that anything or goes from my hands.
Now I'm string my pole.
And so you can see that you're never going to do. So, as I'm going to be down from my hands.
And the purpose of this is simple.
I'm going to open my hand, if it's all right, my animal magnetism's going to get the knife.
In fact, I'll save her place that I can school it, and the knife doesn't fall.
Nothing, I'm going on or down from my hands.
no trick. You can look at anything.
Ta-da!
That's a trick that often I'm going to have.
that they're interested in magic, because you can learn a lot about how they're learning this trick even though methodologically.
Most of you in this room will know this trick.
That's what happens happens in my hand in my hand.
I say, I'd say my pole.
to make sure that nothing goes or scene from my hands, this is a lie.
The reason I'm holder is because it's this secret of illusion.
In the moment that my hand is moving away from you, this finger here, my index here, my index here, my indicates, in a position that's out of it.
There's someone who didn't have a childhood here.
It's so, right.
And when I'm going to move.
We can talk about why it's it's ingannedies, because there's just three finger because the mind, and the way that information, not one, two, three.
But it's not the point. Just when my hand, Obviously remains attached not across the animal magnetism, but across the index here.
And when I ask my finger, same thing when I went back, this movement covers the finger that returns back.
I've got your hand. It's away.
It's a trick you can do with your friends and close. Thank you.
Now, what has to do this with the placebo effect?
I read a study, a year ago, a year ago,
I'm not a medical or a researcher, so it's a surprising thing.
It seems to have a placebo in the form of a white pill in the form of a white pillola, it's just one white pill.
But if you change the shape and you give the placebo, under the form of a smaller pill, and blue color and blue color is visually more effective.
Even though no drug -- it's a drug -- they're sugar.
But a white pillola is not effective as a blue pill.
What? It's really taken me.
But anyway, it's not here.
The capsule is more effectively of each form.
A capsule that's yellow, that's already from the other is better than a capsule.
The dosage has a role.
A pill two times a day, it's not so effective like three pills -- Now, I don't remember the statistics.
But the point is --
these dosages have a role.
And also the shape has a role.
And if you're going to definitive, you have to use a needle.
Right? It's a syringe with something -- a couple of something inert.
You've got it in a patient --
This is an image so strong in their mind, much stronger than the white pillola.
It's real, this graph, I'm going to show you another time when we're slide.
The point is that the white pillola isn't effectively as the blue that's not effective as a chain.
And no one of these has a drug quality.
It's just your belief that makes them in your cover and strength the effect.
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and apply it to a magic trick.
And do something that's a trick and make it seem.
And we know from the study that when you're effect.
That's a little bit of seven polluts.
The sterilize a little bit.
That's my meat. That's not Damian.
This is my skin. This is not a special hollywods.
I'm going to hole my skin and get this shoot until part.
If you're try -- if you're healthy -- I did it for some friends in the tree camera, the other night, and for some who I didn't know, and a woman's almost left.
So if you're trying to easily, suggesting that you don't look for the next 30s -- you know, I'm going to do the first bad in here.
You can see, you can see, you can look at another part.
Here's what happens, right here, right, the beginning of my arm's part of my arm do just a little hole.
Scusami. You're impression?
And now a little crown through my skin, and outside of the other.
Now, we're in the same position that we were with the trick.
More. But you can't contain my fingers now, right?
So I'm going to show you. Here's one, three, four, five.
I know what people think about when you see this.
They're thinking, "It's not going to be stupid by hole for a few minutes."
So, let me leave you a scale.
How do you look like? Well, good enough.
Yeah, I know here behind, "Okay, I don't see it."
People in the rooms are entering.
We're going to show it.
That's my skin. It's not a special effect of Hollywood.
That's my meat, and I can turn it around.
You're hear, if you're hear you're going to look at.
People in the bottom or they're going to look in some years, "Well, it's clearly clear, but if he's true --
You see there's a hole here and a hole here, if it was true. "
Well, I'm going to take a little bit of blood for you.
Here's here.
I'm going to go again.
I could do my arm, and you're going to show you that there are no stop.
But I think in this context and with the idea of taking something false and turn it into something true, and I'm going to let him.
We'll see us several times in the next few days. I don't see the time. Thank you very much.
So in my life, I met a lot of fish.
I've loved only two.
The first one, it's more than another passional story.
It was a beautiful fish knowledge, carnose, it's one of the most selling on the size.
What fish!
It's even better, it's been a doter of the most elevated standard of environmental sustainability.
So you're heard of the consciousness.
I've been involved in a relationship with this beauty for different months.
One day, the head of the company called me and asked me to talk to a dedicated event dedicated to the environmental sustainability.
"I said," I said.
This was a company was trying to solve what's happened a problem for our chef.
How do we keep having the fish in our menu?
In the last 50 years, we've fished in the mares the same way we have rate to the forests.
The destruction was tremendous.
90 percent of the big fish fish, the ones that we like so much the tonns, the halizes, the half fish have drastically reduced number.
There's no matter.
So, we like it or less water, we're going to become part of our future.
There's a lot of topics.
The fish training, for the least most of them, and they're inefficient, and they're inefficient. Take the ton.
It's a big problem is that there's a food conversion of 15 to one.
That means that it takes 15 libers of wild fish to get a book of tiny ton.
It's not very sustainable.
And it's not great.
That's here, finally there was a company was trying to do it in the right way.
I wanted to help them.
The day first day of the event, I've telephone to the public of the company.
Let's call it Don.
"Don," I said, "I said," Don, you're famous to make so far away, in open sea, that you don't pollution. "
"I'm saying," We're so far from the coast that our dots are didn't. "
And then he added "We're basically a world."
"The rate of conversion? 2.5 to one." he said.
"The best in the sector."
25 to one, fantastic.
"2.5 to one thing?" What do you feel to fish? "
"Proteins," he said.
"Great," I said. "And closed the phone.
So that night, I was in bed, I thought, but what the hell, it's a sustainable protein?
So the next day, I'm before the event, I'll call Don.
I said, "Don, you make some example of sustainable proteins?"
He said he didn't know, and she would asked around.
Well, I'm talking to a little bit of people in the company and I'm going to give me a precise response.
So until I'm talking to the biologist.
Let's call it Don.
"Don," I said, "I'm doing sustainable protein?"
Well, he's mentioned a little basis of fish, and then he said, "Peech."
I said, "Peech?"
He said, "Yes, think, skin, bones, bones and bones, skin, bones and processed to eat."
I said, "What percentage of your eath is done of pollo?"
I think, say, the two percent.
"Well, it's about 30 percent." he said.
I said, "Don, what's about sustainable to make chicken?"
There's a long pause to the phone and then said, "there's really too many polls in the world."
I disamount of this fish.
No, because I'm not because I'm one of those virtuous food.
Well, to say the truth are.
No, in fact, I said, I'd like this fish, because I'm going on after that conversation, the fish.
The second fish is a lot of love.
It's a story that type of history to know the fish and I love it.
I'll eat it for the first time in a south of Spain.
My friends journalist had been talking about this fish.
He had to meet us.
I'm going to go to the table color, almost scintilliant.
The chef had a too.
It's about how it had to be cookie.
Incredibly, it was delicous.
Who's able to make a fish so good after it?
I don't, but this guy.
Let's call it Miguel.
It's actually called Miguel.
No, he had no fish the fish, and it's not a chef.
For less, we don't usually intend.
It's a biologist in Veta. The Palma that's a fish of Spain to the Spain to the river of the Guadalquivir.
Until's 80 to the 1980s, the argents.
They had woookay on what first was essentially a paludose.
They had given the Earth by building a series of canal canal, they're going so water in the river.
Well, they couldn't do work the thing from the economic view.
And, from the ecological point of view, it was a disaster.
He had killed something like 90 percent of the birds and, consider the place, it's a lot of birds.
So in 1982, in 1982, a company with an environmental consciousness to buy the ground.
What do they do?
They're putting the water.
They're literally inverse, they're the inner.
Instead of connecting water away from the ground used the sand they used the channels to get it.
They have all the channels.
They created a fish training from 27 mile acres acres, die, death, gams and in this process, Miguel and this company, Miguel and this company is completely the ecological destruction.
It's incredible.
I mean, I don't view something like this.
Look at the horizon that seems to be far away a million miles and everything that you see are the inners and this rich, dense land this recovery, dense, dense land this rich, dense land.
I've been there with Miguel.
It's an incredible kind of farts Charles Darwin and a quarter Darwin.
Okay? We'd done in the middle in the middle of this and I'd have the butter and Miguel, he calculated his balance.
First, I don't rare.
And then he explains me the mineral necessities of fitplankton then see a type of fish that reminds the reminds of Tanzania.
It turns out that Miguel has spent most of his career to the Miguel's National Park in Africa.
I asked him how he became a ty-fish expert.
He said, "Do you know? I don't know about fish.
I'm an expert in relationship. "
And I'm going to launches again a talk about birds, algae and strange plants.
I didn't fascinating, all this was very fascinating, which is, a thing like the biotic community.
There's interesting, but I was in love.
And my head continued to rethink about that delicous fish that I had eaten the precedent.
So I said, "Miguel, what makes your fish so good?"
He's indicated the algae.
"I know, I know, the algae, the phytoplankton, relationship, yes, yes, it's incredible.
But your fish tures what they eat?
What's your rate conversion?
Well, I answer telling me about how their own is a rich system is so rich exactly what the fish is eating in a wild environment.
The biomass of plants, the phitplankton, the zooplankton, it's all the fish.
The system is so healthcare is so healthy.
There's no eating.
Do you've ever heard about a training that it doesn't eat to her animals?
More, I was driving around the ground with Miguel and I said, "In a place like this seems like this natural thing that seems so natural than I've ever seen, how do you measuring the success?"
In that precise moment, it was like if the regist of a film had order.
We took the corner and we saw a scene between the most incredible thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of fenhouse.
"That's the success," he said.
"Look at their pance, they're pans.
They're putting. "
Banchecking? I was completely confused.
I said, "Miguel, but they're not taking your fish?"
"Yes," he said.
"Let's about 20 percent of fish and eggs of fish eggs.
Last year on this property, there were 600,000 species.
Today's became the biggest and one of the most important blood in Europe. "
I said, "Miguel, but a population of birds isn't the last thing you'd like you're in a fish of fish?"
He's what if your head, no.
He said, "We're training so we don't so intensive.
This is an ecological network.
The fenhouse fenough.
The gambers are eating the fitplankton.
So, much more it's pancies the fenhouse, it's the system. "
Okay, then let's hire: A training that it doesn't eat to eat of his predators.
A training of fish, but also a blood birds.
Ah, by the way, those fenhouse would not be there.
They do the nest in a town, 150 miles where the conditions of the soil are better for the construction.
Every morning, they fly for 150 miles, and they come to 150 miles, and every night, they're doing 150 miles for the return.
They do it because they're able to follow the white line.
It's a serious.
I imagined something type, so I looked at the Miguel.
And I said, "Miguel, they fly for 150 miles away to go back?
Do they do it for their little? "
And he looked at me as if I had a Whitney Houston.
He said, "No, they do it because food is better."
I didn't talk about the skin of my fish who was delicious, and I'm usually don't like the skin.
I don't like habbrusted, I don't like to cry.
It's that knew, as of asphalt.
It's not almost never.
And yet, when I took him in that south of Spain's Spain's not knew for skin of fish.
She had a sweet and cleaned was like to give a man at the ocean.
I said this in Miguel, and he annually.
He said, "The skin is like a skin.
It's the last defense before whatever you go to the fish.
It's evolved to hold. "
And then he added "But our water doesn't have impurity."
Okay. Okay. Okay.
It's a training the success of the success of his predators.
And then I realized that when he says he's telling me that alevent doesn't impurity a very minimizes because water that fluize in that alevent comes from the Guadalquivir that's a river that it's a riving figures of pesticide.
And when I flower the system and it's cleaner than when it entered.
The system is so healthy, that it's the water.
So not just a training that it doesn't feeding his animals is not just a requires that his success in the bottom of its predators, but a training that it's literally an water and not just for those fish, but also for me and for you.
Because when the water out of the water, if you go to the Atlantic.
It's a drop in the ocean, but I'm the welcome, and so you're going to do, because this story of love as this romantic love is also instructive.
You could say it's a recipe for the future of the good food is that they're talking about the fish.
What we've now need is a radically new agriculture of agriculture in which food has a good knower.
But for many people, this is a little too radical.
We're not realists, we're passionate.
We're lovering.
Let's lots of small farmers.
We love the little familiar farms.
We talk about food of the local territory.
We're doing biological.
And when you say that these are the things that are going to make sure the future of good food somebody's up and says, "Hey you, even at me and says," Hey you, but how do you think you can feel the world?
How do you feeding the world? "
Can I be system?
It's a question I don't like that.
No, because we're produced already enough to produce the world.
A billion people suffer hunger today.
A billion -- more than they've ever been -- because of the huge inequality in the distribution of not for the amount of complex.
You see, I don't like this question because he determined the logic of our food system in the last 50 years.
To cereal erbivors to the monocultures, chemicals, chicken chicken to fish and all this period, agricultures just asked, "If we can feed the most economic way, what's wrong in what we do?"
This was the motivation.
It was the justification.
It's been the business of American agriculture.
We should call it for what it is, an industry in liquidation an industry that's fast erodding the ecological capital.
This is not an industry, and it's not agriculture.
Our panies today is threatened not cause of shapes in diminution, but for the resources, but for the last mechanical invention, but for the land, it's not for the last mechanical invention, but for the water, it's for the fish, but for the forests and not for fish the fish and the networks, but for the fish.
You want to feed the world?
Let's start asking: How are we going to feeding ourselves?
Or better, how can we create the conditions that allows every communities to nutrite if it?
To do that, we don't look at the future industry.
It's an old model and stances.
It's all in capital, chemistry and never really produced anything good to eat.
Instead, we look at the ecological model.
It's about two billion years of experience on work.
Let's look at Miguel, alevators like Miguel, and the farming that they're not money in closed to farm that they're rebuild instead of consuming instead of consuming instead of consumption but experts in relationships, because they're the ones that are also experts in the knowledge.
If I've got to be really, they're chef better than I could ever be.
You know, it's okay, because if that's the future of good food, it's going to be delicious.
Thank you.
I grew up with a basic diet.
At, I took a school school, an hour and forward every day.
And I'd always immerse in a book, a book of a book, which brought my mind in other worlds, and satisfied, in the narrative, the sense of curiosity that I had.
And that curiosity was manifested in the fact that every time I wasn't in school out in the woooods, snampion, insects, insects, insects, insects, insects, insects and water, insects and water them.
I was a real geek of science.
But it's always about trying to understand the world, understanding the limits of possible.
And my love for the amount of cience looked at the world around me, because what he was going on in, because what was happening, in the 1960 -- we were going to go to the late of the oceans, Jacques Cousteau, Jacques Cousteau, Jacques Cousteau went to our health with his documents that showed us animals and a wonderful world and places us and places a wonderful world and places a wonderful world that showed us.
So, everything seemed to reinforce my own passion for science.
And I was an artist.
I knew to draw. I knew.
And because there were no video games, I had to create these images in the computer movie, or all these pictures in the media, I had to create these images in my head.
From children, when we read a book, we all had to say, through the description of our head.
And so, my answer was painting, drawing creatures, high-aliens, robots, navicles, space, all this stuff.
At mathematics, I'm always wecded to clear behind the book of text.
That's because the creativity had to find one out there somehow.
And it's an interesting thing: the Jacques Cousteau programs were involved for the fact that there was an alien world here on Earth.
Maybe I'd never go to a world in a space on a space.
It seemed very unlikely.
But that was a world where I could go to really, right here on Earth, the richest and exotic than I'd ever ever imagine legacy these books.
So, I decided that I'd become a sumer at the age of 15.
And the only problem was living in a little country in Canada, at 600 miles from the ocean.
But I didn't woookay.
I've seen my father until he found a training school in Buffalo, New York, as as we lived.
And I've been able to take the certificate in a piece of the York in the winter in Buffalo, New York.
And I didn't see the ocean, the true ocean, for other two years, until we move in California.
In the last 40 years, I've spent about 3,000 hours underwater, and 500 of these hours in submersible.
And I've learned that the depth of the oceans, even the oceans, they're rich of surprising life.
The imagination of nature is without borders than our human limited imagination.
Even today, they're intimate from what I'm seeing the immersions.
And my love of love with the ocean continuous, stronger than I've never been.
But when I chose a career, I chose to make movie.
It seemed to be the best way to conciling this smanify to create images.
And as a guy, I was constantly drawn and so forth.
So make movie was the only way to put together images and stories.
Everything came back.
And of course, the stories that I chose to tell were stories of science, "Termintator," Aliens, "Aliens," Aliens. "
And with "The Abyss," I joined my love for the depth and the immersions with realization of a movie.
So, I've got the two passions.
From "The Abyss," came out of something interesting that was to solve a specific problem, which is creature of the water, which is creature of water creature of the computer.
And so it's born, the first character and animated computer you've ever seen in a movie.
And even though the movie didn't do a lot of money, I've been testing of something extraordinary, I've been textraordinary by this magic appear.
You know, it's the law of Arthur Clarke for every sufficiently advanced by the magic.
They were seeing something magic.
And this excited to me.
And I thought, "Fantastic, that's something to be adopted in the movie art."
So, with "Terminator 2," my next film, my next movie, we've been very much beyond.
We're working with Industrial Light and Magic, we created the liquid metal in that movie. The successful metal success of how it would work that effect.
And it worked. And we created a magic.
And we got the same result with a audience.
But we made a little more with that movie.
So, tracking a line between these two experiences of experience, I came to the conclusion that this would have been a world all new world of creativity for artists.
So, I've put a society with Stan Winston, my friend Stan's friend Stan friend, who was the main and designers of creatures in that period, and we've got Digital Digital Digital.
And the principle of society was leaving us shouldn't, the analogical prints and so forth, and so forth, and so forth to go directly to the digital production.
And so we did and gave us a advantage for a little bit.
But we've stay back to the '90 in the' 90s in the part of creatures and characters, that's what we founded society.
So, I wrote this text called "Avatar" with "intention to push on the visual effects, generated to computer, with human emotional characters and realistics generated to computer, and all the main the computer, and all the main the general world.
And it's been released to the mitter.
The kids of society have told me that we couldn't be able to do it for a little.
So, I've accurate it, and I did this movie of a big ship that.
I throw him there as a "Romeo and Giuliet on a ship."
It'd be a love story, a passional movie.
Secretly, what I wanted to do was immerger to see the reliteral of "Tanic."
That's why I did that movie.
And it's the truth. She didn't know.
But I've convinced them. I said, "We're going to stop.
We're going to use it for the beginning.
It's going to be very important. It's going to be a fantastic marketing. "
And I've convinced them to finance.
It seems like this. But this brings us back to the imagination that creates the reality.
Because we've created a reality and six months after me, I found on a submersible Russian at two miles in the North Atlantic, look at the real Titanic from an oil, not in a movie, not in a movie, not in high definition, but really.
I'm standard.
And it took a lot of preparation, we've had to build figure and a lot of other things.
But I'm remained by those immersions, it was like a space mission.
Where's all the technical and require huge planifications.
You'll put it in this capsule, go down to this dark environment where there are no hopes of being saved, where you can't go back from.
And I thought, "Fantastic. It's like to live in a phancience film.
It's great. "
And so, I've been faced by the deep deep exploration of the ocean.
Of course, the scientific component.
It was all.
It was curiosity. It was imagination.
And it was an experience that Hollywood couldn't offer me.
Of course, I could imagine a creature and create a visual effect. But I couldn't imagine what I'm outside.
In our next expeditions, I've seen creatures with hydrothermal open and, sometimes, things that nobody had never seen before, things that nobody had ever seen before, things that nobody had ever seen before, and imagine.
So I was all taken from this and I had to do more.
So I took a curious decision.
After the success of "Titanic," I said, "OK, I'm going to put my own everyday's" Hollywood record for a little bit. "
So we started planning these expeditions.
We found us to go to Bismark and explore it with robotic vehicles.
We're comback to the Titanic.
We took small robots that we had created with an optics.
And the idea was to go inside and make a surface of the ship ship that she had never been done.
Nobody ever looked at the reliterally. They didn't have the means to do it, so we created the technology to do it.
So here I'm the bridge of Titanic, sitting in a submersible, watching them seemed like this, where I knew they looked like this, where I knew they'd playing violinists.
And I'm driving a small vehicle, and I'm driving the ship of the ship.
When I say it, I'm driving it, but my mind is in the vehicle.
It seemed to be physically present within the Titanic of Titanic.
And it's the experience dejellyfish's ever lived, because I'd already before you turn the corner, before the vehicle of the vehicle revehicle, because I had pattern for months.
And the set was based on a replic exact of the ship of the ship.
So it was an absolutely extraordinary experience.
And it really made me to realize that in the telepresence of the telepresence that you can experience through these robots, the mind is injected in the vehicle, the mind is injected in this other form of existence.
It's been very profound.
And it might be a little bit of what it might happen between some decade when we're going to try to have cyborg cyborg for explorations or other reasons in some kind of the future, that I can imagine, from the friendship of which they are.
So we've done these expeditions, and started to appreciate what there was there under, as the open of the deep ocean, where there were these ordinary animals.
It's basically, they're alien on the ground.
They live in an environment.
They don't survive in a system based on the sunlight as we do.
So, you're seeing animals who live close to the water to 500 degrees.
It's even impossible that exist.
At the same time, I was interested in my space science, again, again, again, it's the influence of science.
And I finished in space environment, really involved with the NASA, sitting in the advice advice of NASA, to plan missions, go to Russia, to Russia, spatial missions, and all these things, until fly to the international station with our 3D.
It was fascinating.
But what I've done to do was bring scientists with us.
And leading them down because they could have access -- astrobiologists, planetary scientists, people interested in these extreme environments, bringing them up and allow them to see sample, the tools and so on.
So, we were running about documentaries, but we actually did the science, space science.
I'd closed the range between being fanel of science, from kid, to do those things.
And you know, at this course of discovery, I learned a lot.
I learned a lot of science. But I also learned a lot about leadership.
Everybody thinks that a regists to be a leader, the captain, or something like that.
I didn't know about leadership before we do all those expeditions.
Because I had to say, "What am I doing here? I'm doing here?
Why I'm doing that? I'm doing that? "
You don't make all these spectacles.
Let's go into parts. There's no famous.
People's thinking about it. "Titanic" and "Avatar's" and "I'd doubt.
I've all these documentaries, all these documentaries for a limited audience.
Not a famous, no gloria, nothing. What do I'm doing?
I'm doing it for the task, for the challenge -- and the ocean is the biggest challenge that exists for the discovery, and for the strange of the discovery, and for the strange that's instaura when a small group.
Because we were doing all with 10-12 people, working together for years.
Sometimes for 2-months of file.
And in that connected, you realize that the important thing is the respect that they've for them, when you've done a task that you can't explain to anybody else.
When you go back to the ground and you explain, "We've had to do this, and the optics, and this, all the technology, and this, all the technology, and the difficulty, the aspects of human-perspects when you're working. It's what maybe they're going to explain it. It's what maybe they're going to explain it.
Cree a bunch of respect.
When I came back to make my next movie, which is "I've tried to apply the same principle of leadership oxy-respected leadership the team and in changing my respect.
It's really changed the dynamic.
And so here I am once again with a small group, in sorts of sorts of landing in doing "Avatar" with "new technologies that didn't exist.
Terribly exciting.
It's very committee.
And we became a family, in the arco of four and a half years.
And it completely changed my movie of movie.
People's been telling that I took the organisms from the ocean and I put them on the planet.
For me, it was the essence of doing business, the process in itself, which was changed.
What can we make it that?
What are the lessons that we learned?
I think the first is curiosity.
It's the most powerful thing.
The imagination is a force that can actually manifest one.
And the respect of the group is more important than all the alversus of the world.
Giovans regists are from me and they tell me, "Dams a few advice to do this."
And I said, "Don't poneteves.
Other people will do it for you, I don't do it for you, you don't get against you.
And you're going to go. "
In NASA is saying this sentence: "The error doesn't contemplate."
But the mistakes must be an option in the art and exploration, because it's how to do a jump in.
And no matter that's require innovation was done without risk.
You've got to be willing these risks.
That's the thought I'm going to leave you, which is that anything to do, the mistakes is an option, but it's not. Thank you.
If I wanted to make you figure out today, it would be that the data together is bigger than his parts, and that, instead of thinking too much of its parts, and instead of thinking about how to use information, I'd like to use information, I'd like to make new new real trends.
Here you're seeing statistics of mortality statistics.
This tool I use is a small experiment.
It's called Pivot, and with Pivot, I can pick up a one cause of death, let's say the accidents.
And we see emerging new relationship.
The reason is that here in the central part of the people are more active; and here's more active.
We can do a step back and reorganize the data for death, we're seeing that circulating diseases and cancer are, but not for everyone.
If we're looking forward, and we're saying under the 40, we see the accidents are the cause of death that I worry about more.
I don't go closer, it's all about men.
So you'll have understood that visualizing information and data so it's a little bit like to do.
What if we can do this with data data to do it with the content?
For example here we have the cover of every Sports Illustrated.
That's all of here.
You can go into your rooms and try and look at you.
With Pivot can see a decade.
Or a specific year.
You can isolate a number.
For example, let's take athletes in this number, their sports.
I'm a fan of Lance Armstrong, so click here and I see all the numbers in that Lance Armstrong.
Now, if I want to give us a look at it, I could think, "Why don't we look at all the cyclism?"
I'm going to do a step back and along the view.
And now I see Greg Lemond.
So you'll see that when you're navigate between information like this closer or far away from away and forward it's not just a research, it's not just browser.
But you do something slightly different.
It's a half away we're going to change how we could use information.
Let's make this idea that it might seem a little bit crazy.
We took every single page of Wikipedia and we've reduced it to a short that consists in a small system that's all the time.
I'll show you just the first 500 of the most visit in Wikipedia.
Even in this limited screen, we can do very much.
You can understand what issue areas are the most visited in Wikipedia.
It's this sections.
We'd see that we see that the categories of Wikipedia more associated at this voice is the "Personagons of the Anno" of Time Magazine.
That's significant because it makes something that in Wikipedia doesn't have.
And you're just doing a step back to see this together.
If I'm reading one of these sumption I can then zooom on the Magazine.
and you're all going to see them.
At this point that most of the government is from the science in the world of science. It's a number of business.
Here's my boss.
One is from the music.
And rather interesting, Bono also also won's also won a TED.
So let's go to see all the winners of the TED.
For the first time we're really navigating in the net as if it's a network, it doesn't have a page enough.
I want to show you another thing that might surprise you.
This is the New York Times.
Pivot, this application -- we don't call it browser, because it's not a browser, but it's a browser, because it's not a browser, like this.
I can do a step back and I've got to go back to a specific section. This is important because the pages so it makes me see all my navigation in the same identical way.
I can zooming on what I did in specific moments.
There's in fact that I've just introduced.
I can see in a sense to see other things I saw in the day.
If I'm going to do a step back and see all I can do pieces my historic or the historic of my research or the historian.
I was looking for the potistic, I was looking for the Bing motor Bing, here for Labs Pivot.
And I can zooom on my page and simply released from here.
A metaphor reuse many times, and in every case, and in every case, and in every case, the result of data.
Two, the world, the data is view as a kind of disease.
It's about information sovereign information.
It's about annegar in the data.
What if we took everything, if we put the web underneath instead of going to go from one thing to the other, we're going to get from a lot of other things that we could see those structures that otherwise to see those structures that otherwise?
And then instead of feeling us into data, we could really extract information.
Instead of concern information, we can pull out of knowledge.
And from the knowledge of wisdom.
And with this, thank you.
These times all talk about happiness.
I asked to contain the number of books.
There's a huge waves of happiness, among the researchers.
There's a lot of coaching happiness.
Everybody would like to make people happy.
But despite all this flow of work, I'm a series of "traps" that in some way making cognitive ideas correct on happiness.
My talk today today is going to look at all these "cognitive traps."
And it's about profane people who think about their happiness, and it's about happiness, and they're confused as everybody else.
The first of these traps is the luttance to admit the complexity.
It turns out that the word happiness is not a word useful word as we're going to be too much.
I think that's able to make a particular meaning, but in line, we're going to have to tell us about this acceptions and we're going to have to tell us more complicated than what the wells is. "
The second trap is the confusion between experience and memory. It's practice it's about to choose between being happy and happy.
And these are extremely different concepts, both part of happiness.
And the third is illusion of the oxious focus the unfortunate that we can't think about any circumstance that affects on the well-being unfortunately.
I mean, it's about a cognitive traps.
There's no way to do the right thing.
I'd love to start with an example of one person who, after a session of questions and answers, after a lecture.
[She didn't...] She was listening a symphony at the end of recording to the end of recording to the end of record.
And then he add, in a very emotional way, that he had a whole experience.
But it wasn't true.
What it was broinated was the memory of the experience.
He had lived the experience.
And he had listened for 20 minutes of the wonderful music.
but it didn't mean, because he remained with a certain memory; The memory was breaking.
What this episode tells us, in the bottom, is that we could think about ourselves and other people in terms of two. "
There's a set of experiences, which lives in the present and knows the present, and it's able to review, but it's able to live the present.
It's like "and it's living experiences," and you know when the doctor asks, "You know when the doctor asks," Do you're hurt here? "
And then there's the "self reminds" It's about "Yeah, it's about" the dots, "What's the doctor," What's the doctor to ask, "How are you heard in the last time?"
or "Coman's going to your journey in Albania?" or something like that.
That's two different entity, the self that lives an experience and what if you remember, and what if you remember two is part of the confusion of happiness.
The self that remember, it's a single.
And this process begins with a fundamental answer of our memories -- starts immediately.
We don't tell stories only when we decided to tell them stories.
Our memory tells us stories, which is, what's remains us about our experiences is a story.
So let me start with an example.
It's an old study.
That's the experiences of two patients during a painful procedure.
I'm not going to go to detail. It's not even pain painful day, but it was painful when this study was conducted in the '90s.
You asked patients to bring their pain every 60 seconds.
And here's the results for two patients.
Those are their results.
If you ask, "Who's suffered?"
It's a very simple question.
Of course, the Patient B has suffered.
her columping over and over and over every minute of pain's suffered by the patient A patient.
But now, there's another question: "How these patients think about suffered?"
And here's the surprise: It's the Patient A memory of the B.
The stories of the colones were different given that a particularly delicated part of procedure is the way in which -- no one of these stories is particularly positive -- no one of the two is particularly worse -- one of the two is particularly worse -- one of the two is particularly worse of the other.
And it's the worst was where the pain was up at the end.
It's a negative story.
How do I know that?
Why did we asked these people after the column, and even at the distance of time, "How negative was the experience, all considered?"
and it results of the worse for A that for B, in the memory.
So it's a directly conflict between the cheating experiences and the reminds.
From's view that lives the experience, it's clear that B has suffered most.
So what you could do for the patient A patient A, and we've effectuated experiments, and it's really done, and it's really done, and it's been done by keeping tube too.
This is going to cause a little pain in, but just a little bit less than before.
And by doing this for a couple of minutes, the shares that live the experience.
How do you call a story?
And that's worth for stories that are being the memories that we invent what we're definitely changes a story, are the significantly changes and final.
The finals are very, very, very important and in this case, the final dominated.
So, the cheese live experiences his life in the way.
It's movements that live. It's what's going to happen?
And the answer is simple.
And I'm always telling that most moments of our life -- for how I've calculated them -- I mean that in one life, I mean that in one life, we know, at about 600,000 million. In a month if they count about 600,000 million in a month if they don't leave.
Most are completely ignored by the sheet.
And yet, somehow you've got the feeling that what's going on in these times of experience is our life.
It's the limited resources that we're in this world.
And as you spend it, it's relevant, but it's not the story that memories for us.
So we've got a sses and a sses that live experiences that are quite different.
The largest difference between the two is how to treat the time.
From's view that lives the experiences, if you're going to vacation, and the second week is fun as the first, then the vacation of two times better than the vacation of a week.
But that's not absolutely how it works the shares works.
It's just remember, a vacuum of two weeks is vacuum better than a week, because there are no new memories in add.
You don't have changed the story.
And that's time is variable variable critics that distinguishing the sses that reminds the experiences.
The time has a limited impact on this story.
Well, the sses that remember the experiences is more than remember and tell stories.
It's actually the self that makes decisions because, if we consider a patient who had, for example, two different doctors with two different doctors and he's deciding what two two different docs and it's going to be the doctor, what he'll be the doctor.
The cheese experiences doesn't have voice in those choices.
In fact, we don't choose between experiences, but among the memories of those experiences.
And even when we think of our future, we don't think about our future as experiences.
We think of our future as an ancient memories.
And basically you can consider this situation, like a tyranny of the sses that memories, and you can think of the sses that it's reminds that it's living experiences across which, the evidence that lives the experiences, you don't need.
I have the feeling that when we're done in vacuum that, it's going into a good part to the service of our shares that remember.
And this is a little difficult to justify.
That's how we consumer our memories?
That's one of the explanations that it's given for the chance.
When I think of that, I'm in my mind in the Antarctica of a few years ago, that's one of the best vacation of my life, and that I think, relatively often to other vacines.
And I've probably spent to think about that journey of that journey of that journey, 25 minutes in the last four years.
If I'd ever open the card with 600 photographs of the journey, I would spspend an hour another time. It's three weeks of journey and a half. It looks like this.
Well, I could be a little bit of extreme, in my apetite shaped for consumption, but although I'd you do more than this, a question genuine is.
Why do we as weight to memory respect to the weight that experiences?
I want you to think about an experiment with an experiment.
Imagine that during the next vacines, you know that at the end of the vacation of all the photographs will be destroyed, and you take a medicine for the friend so you don't remember it.
You're going to choose the same vacation? What if you could choose a different vacity, you creates a conflict between the two, and you have to think about how to solve this conflict and it's not so obvious because if you think in terms of time, then you're thinking in terms of time, then you're going to have a response.
And if you think in terms of memories, you could get another answer.
It's because we choose the vacances that we do, it's a problem that's a problem in front.
The two house of happiness.
There's two concepts that we can use, one for each other.
So, what's happy, what's happy the healthy?
And then you'd ask: How happy are the moments in the life of the shelves?
And it's about -- happiness, it's a complicated process.
What are the emotions that we can measure?
And, by the way, we're able to do a good idea of happiness of the happiness of the happiness of the happiness of time.
If you're question of the self that remember, it's a completely different thing.
It's not how a live person's happy.
It's about how much I satisfied or it's when it thinks about her life.
It's a very different idea.
Everyone can't tell these two notions, it's not going to do anyone else confusion in happiness, and I'm belonging to happiness, and I'm a group of well-being, and I'm going to do that.
The difference between the happiness of the evidence that lives the experiences and satisfation of the space that memories has been recognizes in the last few years, and they're now efforts to measuring the two separately, the Gallup has a global level where over half a million people have been subjected to a question about what their life and their experiences.
And you've been other studies in this direction.
So in the last years, we started to learn about happiness of the two shoes.
And the biggest lesson that we've learned, is that they're very different.
You could know how one person is satisfied with your life, and it's community with your life, and it's not very much about how they're living their lives and vice.
To give you an idea of correlation, the correlation is about 0.5.
What means if you'd mean you'd mean, oh, oh, he said, "oh, his father's height?
Well, you'd know something about his height, but with a lot of uncertainty.
You'd always a little bit of uncertainty.
If I tell you that someone thinks that his life is at eight in a scale from one to 10, you're going to be very uncertainly how happy I'm lives.
So the correlation is low.
We have a certain knowledge of what controls is happy.
We know that the money is very important, the goals are very important.
We know that it's happy means to be satisfied with people that we like, spent time with people we like.
They are other please, but these are the main.
So if you want to massimize happiness of the two shoes, you're going to end very different things.
The conclusion of what I've told is that we shouldn't think about happiness as a substitute of well-being.
It's two completely different ideas.
In more, very, very quickly, another reason we can't think in a way that we don't pay attention to attention to the same things when we think about life, and when we live life.
So if you're asking the simple question about how they're in California, you don't get the right response.
When you ask this question, you think you should be happier in California, which in Ohio.
What happens is that when you think about life in California, you're thinking about the contrather between California and other places, and for example that confront is on climate.
Well, it's climate isn't so important for the shees and it's not very important for the sex that reflects is what's deciding how they're happy.
But because it's reflects, you might end up -- some people might end -- some people could end, go to California.
And it's interesting to versus what's going to happy in California in the hopefully of being happy.
Well, there's that lives the experiences doesn't become happy.
We know it.
But something's going to happy. They think they're more happy, because when they think about it, you'll remind was in Ohio.
And they're thinking about the right decision.
It's very difficult to think of well-being, and I think I've given you the idea of it is.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have a question for you.
Thank you very much.
When we were at the phone weeks ago, he mentioned me that a few weeks ago, he mentioned me that a result of the Gallup.
It's something that thinks we can share seen that we've got a few minutes?
Daniel Kahneman: Yeah.
I think the more interesting result that we've found in the Gallup. It's a number, that we didn't expected to find.
We've found that, with reference's live experiences.
When we've observed how various various feelings, we discovered that, at the under of a 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans, on an Americans, one study on a very vast sample of about 600,000 American Americans, it's a representative sample of a 600,000 Americans per year --
CA: 60,000 DK: 60,000 dollars a year, the people are infelectric, and they become progressively, and they became more progressively, Al of over that, we're going to find a field.
I mean, I've seen rarely lines.
Carely, what happens is that the money doesn't buy happiness of experience, but the lack of denarly water misery, and we can measure that misery, very clearly.
In terms of the other history, the sses that remember, it's all another story.
The more money, the more content six.
That's not emotions about emotions.
CA: But Danny, all the efforts of Americans are about life, freedom, freedom, freedom, the research of happiness.
If people were taking this discovery seriously discovery, they're putting everything we're created, for example, the politics on the taxes and so on.
There's a chance that politicians, and the nation in general, can take a discovery like that seriously and bring a forward politics based on it?
DK: You know I think I'm going to recognize the role of happiness in public politics.
It's going to be slow in the United States, there's no doubt, but in the U.K. is getting reality, and in other states.
People are starting to recognize that they're thinking about the public policy.
It's going to get a bit and people are going to begin whether they want to study the experience of happiness or whether they want to study the valuation of life that we need to start this debate in the midle.
As growing the happiness, it takes different directions of how you think, and second you think, and the second you're thinking, and at the second you're thinking about experiences.
All this influences, I think, in the years that they're going to do.
In the United States, they're doing efforts to measuring the experience of the population.
And this, I think, it's going to get part of the next decade, maybe two, the national statistics.
CA: Well, it seems to me that this is going to be, or less it should be, or not for it, the most interesting political to follow in the next few years.
Thank you very much for invented the behavioral economy.
Thank you, Danny Kahneman.
I'm going to talk today about energy and climate.
It can seem strange, seen that in my work at the foundation of vaccines and seeds, things to invent and seeds, things to invent and giving the world to help the lives.
But the climate and energy, actually, they're extremely important for this people, in fact, they're more important to them for anyone else in the world.
A worst climate means, for a lot of years, loss of crops.
It'll be too much rain, or too few.
They're going to change in ways that their environment can't sustain.
Which leads to hunger. There's conflicts.
So climate cameras, they're going to be for their terrible.
Even the cost of energy is, for them, important.
In fact, if you could leave the price of one thing, to reduce the poverty, choose of energy.
The energy price is shelter in time.
And a civilization is projects to the energy progress in energy camp.
The carbon revolution revolution.
And even in the 20th century, we've assisted to an electricity in electricity, which explains why we have frigone, conditions, we can create modern materials and so many.
In the rich world, so we're about how electricity electricity in a situation.
But while the price, for example, the half of half, we need to respect a new window, the vincole of CO2 emissions.
CO2 is scale on the planet, and his equation is very simple.
CO2 emity-CO2 emperature, which induces very negative effects.
Booes on climate and, maybe even worse, India, in the sense that the natural ecosystems can't look at these rapids and so they collapse.
The valuation of how the temperature temperature because of a CO2 increase in CO2, and as each of the two worst things, it's not very much.
And there's certainly uncertainty about how negative they're going to be extremely negative.
At, I've often asked the best scientists: We have to really reduce emissions almost to zeroom?
We can't just reduce them to half or a quarter?
And the answer is that, until we go to zero, the temperature will keep up.
It's a big challenge, so.
It's not like to say, "Let's do a truck."
It's not about it. "
It's about to be zero.
Now, we have a lot of CO2 every year, over 26 billion tons of tons.
About 20 tons for every American.
For poor, poor countries, it's less than a tone tons.
The worldwide media is about five tons.
And in some way, we need to make progress that amount of zero.
The emissions are constantly augmented.
Only some economic changes have changed this tendency, so we've got to spend from rapidly to diminum up to zero.
This equation has four factors.
It's a series of multiplications.
We have the amount to the left, the CO2, that's supposed to be, and the factors on the right is the population, the services that in the average, the services that in the average, the media requires and the COeman unit for energy.
Let's go to each factor and we see how we're seeing it.
Probably, one of these numbers has to leave them almost zeroos.
It's algebra of high.
Let's see a little bit.
The first factor is the population.
The world is 6.8 billion people.
We're ty to nine billion.
If we make a good work with new vaccines, healthy, health, health, we can decreate it maybe 10, 15 percent, but here we record an increase, 15 percent, but here we record an increase in about 30 percent.
The second factor is the services we use.
Which understanding everything, the food that we eat, the westist, the warming.
It's stuff, and liberate it means to provide these services for almost everybody in the world.
And it's a positive thing that this numbers.
In the rich world, in the richest billions, probably we could save and use less, but in media, every year, this number of.
And so, complex, the amount of whether it's going to be more than doubled.
This is a very simple example of service.
You've got illumination in your house, to do the tasks, but these kids don't, so they're going to do the streets.
As efficiency -- And, the energy for unit for heroage service -- finally, there's good news.
This factor is not.
Thanks a lot of inventions, new ways of lights, new ways of lights, automobiles can make differently, for a lot of services, you can decrease in consumed energy.
In some services, you can reduce 90 percent.
There's other services, like fertilizes, like fertilizers, or the airplane transport.
So, complex, in the best of cases, the energy consumed energy consumed from three to to six times.
But these first three factors are reducing emissions from 26 to the best cases, maybe 13 billion tons.
It's not enough.
Let's look at quarter, the key's amount of CO2 emit for energy.
The question is, can we reduce that?
If you burning carbon, no.
If you burn natural gas, no.
Almost all the ways to produce today the electricity, to part of renewables and nuclear, they're CO2.
What we're going to have to do on global scale, so it's creating a new system.
And we need to be miracles.
It's miracle, "I don't mean something impossible.
The microprocessor is a miracle. The computer is a miracle.
Internet, and his services, it's a miracle.
People today have participated to the creation of many miracles.
We don't usually have a data, a date line.
It's usually the window and something else.
In this case, instead, we need to drive all speed, and make a miracle in a very restretes.
I asked me: How do this concept?
There's an example, some demonstration that captures the imagination of people?
I thought about a year ago, when I brought to mosquitos, and people find it fun.
She's compared them that, in the world, there are people who live with the mosquitos.
This is my idea for energy.
I've decided that flies would be this year my contribution to the environment.
Here's here here.
They don't tell me that they couldn't even go out of them.
So now, we can invent us as this, but it's not going to be held.
We need solutions, a lot of solutions, or that they're working on large and very reliable, and although they're exploring in many directions, I think only five could surprised.
I've excluded the geoterms, the nuclear fusion, the biofuels.
They could also give some contributes, and if they can do more than I expect, so much better, but here I'm interested in it, but here's interested in that we're going to have to work on each of those figures, because it's all the hard challenges.
Let's go to the first fossil fuels, carbon or gas.
Here's our task, but it's not, and it's capture, and it's capture, and it's captured it, and hope that remains us.
Today, there's experimental technologies that capture 60 percent -- 80 percent of CO2, but they're achieved 100 percent will agree, and it's going to agree about where all this CO2.
It's the most spinous issue of the longer.
Who's going to trust?
Who will tell something that's literally billions of times more voluminous than all sorts of imaginable rejected, like nuclear or anything?
It's a huge volume.
So it's a difficult problem.
Another source would be the nuclear.
But also the nuclear is three large problems.
The cost, especially in countries, it's high.
The issue of safety, the feeling sewhere nothing can go wrong, despite the impact is manegged by human operators, and that the fuel doesn't get used to use the purpose.
And how to run the shoots?
Mald the amount of reduced, concerns are so many.
People need to be survey.
So that's very difficult, so that you could solve, and on what you should work.
The last three of the five sources, I've care.
It's what people often define. "
And to say the real, despite the large advantage of not require a fuel, they're some disadvantages.
The first is that the density density of energy with these technologies is decided to that of an electric central to one central electric central.
It's about "and it's a lot of lots of square kilometers, of thousands of times as a normal electric normal electric.
And also, these sources are intermitted.
The sun doesn't get all day, neither all the day, and it's the wind always.
So if you're depends on these sources, you need to find an electric energy even even when the source doesn't produces.
Grosse challenge us to the front of the cost.
And on distribution.
For example, let's say that this energy source.
So you don't just need technology, but you've got to do the risks of approval.
And finally, the accumulation problem.
To estimate the dimensions of the problem, I've analyzed all kinds of bacteries, computers, telephones, car, telephone, I'm confronted to the amount of electric energy that all the bacterial energy that all the batteries could be less less than 10 minutes of all that energy.
So we really need a huge step forward, a improvement of 100 times than the approaches in use now.
That's not impossible, but it's not very simple.
This problem is already when the sources "intermitt-produce, say, 20 or 30 percent of energy consumed energy.
If you've done those sources for 100 percent, you need a battery battery. "
But how do we advancing on this street? What's the right approach?
Is it a Manhattan?
Most companies, at hundreds, they have to put to work.
We need at least percent people in each of these five sectors.
Most of them, you're looking at them, you're going to call them.
And I think here, in the TED group, many people are already working in these fields.
Bill Gross has several companies, between which one called eSolar that vants large technologies in the sun.
Vinod Khosla is investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting potentiality, and I'm giving my support to do this.
Nathan Myhrvold and I'm financing a company that, it's surprising the street.
There's some innovations in the rate, the modular nuclear, the liquid nuclear.
But from a little bit of time, the sector is stopped, that there's some good ideas around is not so surprising.
Terrather's idea is that, instead of burned out of uranium, the U235, the U235, the uranium available, we decided to burn to the U238, 99, it's a crazy idea, in some sense.
To the truth talking about a long time, but it's not adequately tried if it's worked or not, even by the way of the modern supercomputers, you can make a simulation and see that there, with the right materials.
And because it burn 99 percent of uranium, the structure of uranium, the structure of the best cost.
It's burned, and they used as fueled as combustable to the reactors of today, which they become, from the problem that they were, a resource.
It's consumer while it's a kind of candle.
It's like a woood that burned. It's called reactor a progressive.
From view of fuel the problem is solved.
Here's a picture of a place in Kentucky.
That's the 99 percent of uranium, 99 percent of uranium, which is called the uranium, and so it's called an impoverium.
These "would give you energy at the United States for the United States.
And in the water of sea, with a economic process, there would be enough fully fuel for the rest of life of this planet.
So many challenge challenges us, but this is an example of the hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to progress.
How should we measure our progress?
What should they have the pair pay?
We dentify the goal, and then we valve the package.
You'll have heard a lot of people talking about a reduction of 80 percent for 2050, It's really important to be able to do.
20 percent will be produced by the poor countries, and from a little bit of agriculture.
At that point, we're going to have solved the deforestation and production of cement.
To coming to 80 percent, so, the developed nations, including nations like China, have to replace their electric production.
The other question is, we're making this technology to emissions?
We put it in practices in developed nations?
Do we're spread?
It's a very important thing.
It's a key element element.
And I don't look like to have the pay of 2020?
Even that would have the same two aspects.
We'd have to implementate of efficiency to begin to get some reductions.
We're going to be the amount of CO2, and therefore the temperature.
But the vote in this matter, to do things that they don't behave a big reduction, or even slightly inferior, to the other, which is the speed of innovation.
We need to push these progress, and we can measuring the speed from the number of companies, pilot of companies projects, regulations of regulation projects.
A lot of great books have been written books were written.
The Al Gore's book, "and" David McKay, "Sustainable Energy Without of the Hot Air."
These books deep the problem and create a context in which they take the debate because these things we need to have a difficult hard.
Most things have to happen.
So I have a wish, so.
A very concret wish that we're going to invent technology necessary.
If I had to choose a wish for the next 50 years, I could choose the president of the country, the realization of a vaccine, the realization of vaccine, or making this thing that's coast and it doesn't produce CO2, choose this last.
It would be the most impact.
If this wish doesn't do, the sentence between people who think about short and who who's long-term and the China, between the poorer and rich countries, will be terrible, and most of all, the life of those two billion people's going to be great worse.
So what do we have to do, so?
What's I'm inviting you to take the initiative and process?
It's necessary to research.
When countries come together in places like Copenhagen, they shouldn't talk about CO2.
They'd discuss the program of innovations, and it's stupid that we invest in these innovative approaches.
They need incentives, incentives on CO2, the cap and trade, the cap and transition, tools that evidence the cost of the pollution.
We have to spread the message.
We need to make this dialogue and understandable, and it has to include the choices of government.
It's a commitment wish, but I think.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Thank you. Just to know more about Terrapower, here's --
first of all, can you give us an idea of the dimension of investment?
Bill Gates: Realizing software, water the supercomputer, assumption all the big scientists, which we already have done, requires only tens of millions, and even when we're going to be safe, we're going to talk, we're going to be safe, we're going to talk about only hundreds of millions.
The difficult thing is to build the pilot is to build the pilot, find varied varied billions, the competent authority, the place where it's going to build the first examples.
Once built the first, if it works as an announced, it's going to be the Colombo, because the cost, the density of energy, they're completely different from the nuclear that we know today.
CA: So, if I understand well, this implement building, well-underground, of a vertical service, of a vertical service, of this type of uranium.
Then the process begins from the high and progress?
BG: Right. The reactors, today, they're reactors, a lot of people who can't work, a lot of controls that can't work, opening, things that entering and out --
It's not good!
If instead, it's very economical and you can go to 60 years, put it inside and forget them in and forget all those complexity.
It's there, burn for sessentially, and then it ended up.
CA: A nuclear implant that it's doing it.
BG: Yeah. Well, the waste you can leave them in there, put them in another reactor and burning them in another reactor and burn them.
And we're going to start with the existing of exist, now conserved in reactors or in containers.
They're going to be our first fuel.
So what it was a problem of conventional reactors is going to be the fuel of our, and the volume of the waste, and the volume of this process is going to be reality.
CA: But when you're talking around the world of this technology, where most interested in its realization?
BG: Well, there's not a particular place, and there's all these interesting transparency on all that is defined nuclear, so we're very interest.
Our staff was in Russia, India, China.
I just met the Secretary for Energy.
We've been talking about how this idea this idea.
I'm optimistic. French and Japanese did in this camp.
It's a variation about something that's already been done.
It's a substantial improvement, but it's a kind of fast reactor, that many countries have built, so anyone who's built a good reactor.
CA: CA: You have you, what's the probabilities and probability that one thing like this?
BG: Well, for one of these projects at the whole, which produces energy produces that produces energy, which produces energy is that it's not very, talking about 20 years to design it and 20 to build it.
It's that the environmental modedemonstrate.
Terrather, if it's okay, that's not ask, it might easily satisfy.
And now there are lucky, fortunately, dozens of companies in the sector, which analogly, if they're the financiments for their plants, they're going to be able to compete.
And it's better if a lot of solutions will succeed, because it's going to reminder a together of solution.
It's necessary that at least one.
CA: Parling of important innovations, revolutionary innovations, this is the biggest that you know?
BG: A energy revolution is the most important thing.
It would be also without environmental environment, but the environmental winds it makes it much more important.
We're about nuclear, there are other innovators.
We don't know their job like this, but one's a nuclear, "a different approach." a different approach.
There's a liquid reactor. It seems difficult to make, but maybe they're perhaps they say the same.
So they're different, but the beautiful is that a molecule of uranium spring a million times more energy than a molecule of a molecule of molecule, so if you can run the negative aspects, the potential, in terms of effects, in terms of effects, in terms of the environment.
CA: And if it doesn't work, what do we do?
We shouldn't have to begin to begin to try to keep the emergency temperature?
BG: If you're in that situation, it's a little bit like when you're eating too, and you're going to have a heart attack.
Where do you go to that point? You could need a surgeon or something like.
There's a whole line of research on geo-engineering, which are various technical various techniques that would slow us to coordination.
It's like a clear polyness.
I hope I don't need it.
Some told you that you shouldn't have to work to work, because you could impigrie, you're going to go to eat because so much the surgeon you.
I don't think it's a choice, view the importance of the problem, but now in the environment of the geoengineering, or the innovations that precipitine, or innovations coming to precipitine.
CA: Clima-scptics: If I had a sentence or two to tell them, how could you persuadership them?
BG: Well, unfortunately, there's many kinds of skeptics and the advances that are very few.
Some people say there's a negative feedback to the cloud that they died the effects of the warming effects.
They're very, very few things that you can just say that there's a probability on a million that you're going to be like to look like AIDS.
It's a mistake now and you pay the consequences just a lot later.
And so, when you're pressed by a thousacrifices, the idea of doing sacrifices that you'll see results only after...
sacrifices for don't well notes.
In fact, the's relationship of IPC doesn't necessarily, people in the rich world's rich people in the rich world and says, Okay, it's not then so bad.
The fact is, it's that uncertainty should pushing us.
But my dream is that, if we can do this economically, and I'm going to respecticles on CO2, then the skeptics, I don't care CO2, I don't care CO2, almost prefer, but I'm going to happen, but I'm going to accept it because it's cheaper.
CA: It's the answer to the Bjorn Lomborg's reasoning all your energy is trying to solve the problem of CO2, your other goals, they're going to be sacrified, and that the money, when there's the money, when there's better stupid?
BG: Well, the spending in research and development --
Let's say that the U.S. should spend 10 billion in more than they do now.
It shouldn't have to go to other purpose.
The stuff that are very money, and here also people who are reasonable to feel, they're the anti-economic financial solution.
It's above all that, the waste.
It's under you don't learning the curve, close to the point where you're going to become very chefforts in technologies that have the potential of technologies that have the potential to dramatically dramatically.
If the alternative was, "Let's make the energy expensive, so that only the rich can allow it to pay the" all of the present energy five times as much without change.
The disaster would be for those two billion.
And even Lomborg has reviewed his positions.
His argument now is, "Why don't you're talking about more than Research and Sen?"
For his past again, "skeptics," but he realized that it's a tremendous group, and so it's restrict, and so it's the question of the Resesesearch.
And it's a question that I think it's appropriate.
It's amazing as little development in research and development.
CA: Well, I think I'm going to talk to the name majority of the audience, saying that I hope to see your desire become reality. Thank you.
BG: Thank you.
I'd like to share with you a discovery that I did a few month ago while I was writing an article to Wired.
I've always my disasters to hand every time I writing something, but I'd already finished to correct the article and I realized that I've never in my life looking for the word "to see what I was going to find.
Let me read you the read.
"Disease," again, again, involved, unuseless, unuseful, crown, standing, smoot, stroyed, swept, zooopie, smart, sympathetic, consumed, the paralysis, Seny, decrept, hopefully, weather, unusual, indebes and debes.
Contravel: In form, strong, hables.
I was reading this list to high voice to a friend and at the beginning, it was so ridiculous, but, as I was so ridiculous, but as I read the word die, and I had to stop my voice, and I had to stop up from the shock shock and from the impact that the assumption of these words to me.
You know, we're talking about naturally a symonymes.
I'm thinking, it's going to be an old, right.
But, in fact, the construction of the early 80.
when I was starting the elementary schools and I was training and learning what was out of my family and learning what was out of my family and on things to the other children and the world around me.
And, I mean, thanks to God, I wasn't using the dictionary of the symonies at that time.
I mean, from this explanation seems that I was born in a world that sees somebody like me like one who see somebody like me as I have no positive for them, when I did today, I'm celebrated for the opportunity and adventures that my life process.
So, I'm immediately went to see about 2009 in the network, waiting for me to find a review without value.
This is the advanced version of description.
Unfortunately, it's not much better.
I'm going to find two words under "particularly contrary," I'm reading, "and" heavy "So, it's not just about words.
That's what we think of people when we notice them with these words.
It's about the values behind these words, and how we build these values.
Our language influence our own thinking and our view of the world and how we see other people.
In fact, a lot of antic civilization, including that Great, and that Romana, believed that it was more powerful, because to say things to higher the existence.
So, what do we want to bring to exist, one person that's limited, or a person with higher force?
So casually, I'm doing something simple as a guy, a child, a child, we could put them on their force.
We wouldn't want to open for them?
One person, who opened me the doctor was the doctor of's been the doctor of the Delaware, Delaware.
His name is Dr. Pizooop.
Italo-American, whose name, apparently, it was too difficult to pronounce for most Americans, so it became.
And the doctor, he'd been wearing paper, and he had a perfect inclination to work with children.
I was basically anything that I've spent that I've spent in the hospital, with the exception of physessions.
I had to do what seemed infinite repetition of exercizes with these elastics, in different colors, in different colors, you know, to help build muscles.
And I hated these elastics more than everything.
I'd hated them, I've gone, really hated them.
And, you know, I'd already, as a five years with Dr. TP to try to go away from these exercizes, he's clear.
And, one day, it came to one of my situation sitting and unesorable, these sits.
And he told me, "wow, Aimee, you're a strong child so I think you're going to break one of those fases.
"When my stuff, I'm going to give you 100 dollars."
Now, of course, it was just a small maneeum of the doctor for me to do the exercizes that I didn't want to do to the perspective of being the second plan, but, what he did, it was to give a different form to a horrible routes journalist.
and turn it into a interesting experience for me.
And I'm today, the entity of his view, and his declaration about how a strong child, he redefined my view of myself in a strong, poder and across the future.
That's an example of how adults they can flow the force of a child.
But in the example of first with those definitions in the vocabulary of the symonymes, our language that we're all going to evolve, the possibilities of an individual see if it's possibilities.
Our language, it wasn't been the step of our society, many of which have been created by technology.
certainly, from a medical point of view, my legs, my legs, the claims of titanium and even review of titanium and even review agable bodies that are helping people cooperating their abilities, and move to go to the side of the ability that nature has imposed, and move to the people who have been imposed, to description to the people, so they're getting global networks with their choice.
So, maybe the technology has been revealing us now more clearly what's always a truth, which each one has been a real, which each one has something rare, and human ability to adapt is our largest quality.
The human ability to adapt us, it's something interesting, because people have always wanted to talk to me about difficulty unty, and I've got to admit.
This phrase never went right, and I've always heard in disconfort in the answer to people to this. And I think I'm starting to understand why.
It's subject in this sentence, unsurprising adversity, it's the idea that success, or happiness, it's reemerging from the other side of this experience, if my succeed in the life came from a ability is to schiving the present of a life with the prosthetic, or what people feel like my disability.
But, in fact, we're marched, logically, a challenge, from a challenge, physically or both.
And I'm going to suggest that's a good thing.
The adversity is not a obstacle that we need to begin to start our life.
It's part of our life.
And I'm trying to think it's like my shadow.
It's very much, and sometimes almost anything, but it's always with me.
And, of course, he didn't try to make the impact, the weight of suffering.
There's adversity and the challenges in life, and it's all true and relative to every single person, but the question is not if you're going to do.
So, our responsibility is not simply to protect the people to care from adversity, but prepare them to receive them to receive them to receive them to received the right way.
And we make a damage to our children when we do feel that they're not ready to adapt.
There's an important difference and distinction between medical objective doctor to be a person printed and the subjective opinion of the society that see me or not.
And, in truth, the consistent disability that I've had to describe if the world has thought I could be described by those words.
In our wish our desire to protect those who we love them a cold, hard truths, or, really, really, the project of their life expectancy, we need to be safe that we don't put the first morning in a wall that they're doing someone.
Maybe the existent to look at what there is broken you and how it's broken and how to put it in place, it can indebulating disease that the disease itself.
I don't treat one person in the complete, you don't do understand his potentiality, we're creating another disease that they already.
We're actually giving a vote to the value of a person in our community.
So we need to see through the disease and inside the light of human capability.
and, much more important, there's a relationship between those insufficiences and our great creativity.
So, it's not to deal, or negar, or negar, these numerous research as something we want to avoid or discovering under the tape, but rather to find those opportunities in a accident.
So, perhaps the idea that I want to explain is that there's not what it's like to see it, as it makes us dancing it up, maybe even dancing us, maybe even dancing us, maybe even dancing us.
And perhaps, if we look at an accident as a natural thing and useful and useful, Never, we're less sraffer from the presence.
This year we celebrate the doubt of Charles Darwin, and it's 150 years ago, when I writing about evolution, which Darwin illustrate, I think, the true of the human character.
To say it in another way, it's not the strongest speces that survive, and it's not even the most intelligent, it's the one that's fit to change.
The conflict is the genesis is.
Darwin work of Darwin, among other things, we can recognize that human ability to survive and develop has led by the suffering of the human spirit through conflicts.
So again, transformation, it's our largest quality.
And perhaps, we don't know what we're done.
Maybe that's what's adversity, a sense of their force.
So we can do a gift.
We can re-imagine adversity as something more of difficult.
Maybe we can see it as a change.
The adversity is a change at which we don't still fit.
I think the largest adversity we've created is this idea of normal. Now, who's normal?
There's no normal. There's a common, there's no normal.
And you'd like to meet those poor people were there?
I don't think.
If we changed this paradigm from one of how to get normal about how to get the normal, or potentiality, to be adigm a little bit more dangerous, we can understand the force of so many children, and inviting them to bring their precious capability with community.
The anthropologist us that what we, as humans, we've always wanted to members of our communities is to be held, we could contribute.
There's an evidence that in Olands, 60 years ago, they brought to triumph, and perhaps with graves, and maybe, thanks to the experience and survival of these people was the evidence of the community: They didn't see this as well as well as well as well.
A few years ago, I was in a market citizens where I grew up in that red area in the north of the Pennsylvania.
and I'd stick in front of a cestture.
It was summer and I'd doubt.
I heard this guy, his voice behind me said, "but, it's not Aimee Mullins." And I turned to me, and there's this guy. I didn't know what it was.
And I said, "I'm sorry, we don't remember that I'm never remind." He said, "He said," But, I don't remind.
I met when we met, when we'd met you're born from your mother. "
You know, that guy.
And, of course, in fact, it was a sample.
That's the Dr. Kean, a man I had only known from the stories of my mother on that day, because, clearly, clearly, typically, I came to retargets.
And so, the guy of my mother's obstetric of my mother had gone in the vacation of my parents.
And as I was born without the peron, and I'd gone, I'd gone in, some fingers in this foot, and he had to be the messager, this stranger had to be the messager.
He said, "I had to give this project to your parents that you'd never walked, and you'd never walked, and that you would never have the kind of mobility, and you've gone of independent life, and you've been given by the way," Risate. "It's what's amazing my childhood, that I walked into my school, a bottom,
I'd marched with Girl Scout, you know, the Halloween, I won my own study, or all my livtories, or all my livtories, and he used them, by teaching the students of his course, including the students in Hahnemann and Hersheeth school.
And he's called this part of the course, the potentiality of human will.
There's no project can hold in known how much poder it can be and how much it's determining in the quality of life.
And the doctor Kean continued to explain me and he said, "In my experience, unless they're said," In my experience, and even though it's given the same, if it's gone. "
See, so Dr. Kean changed his opinion.
He understood that there's a difference between a medical condition and what each one can do with it.
And there's been a change in my thinking during this, if you had been asked me when I was 15 years old, if I was 15 years old, if I'd exchanged in meat a second.
I dreamed that kind of normally.
If I ask this today, I'm not sure.
And it's because of the experiences I've had to do with them.
and, perhaps, the change in me, because I've been exposed to the people who've opened the door of those who have obstaculated.
You see, all you need is a person that you need is a person that shows you the epiphania of your potential, and you're starting to give someone who's asked them, if you can do it and open a doors for someone in a crucial moment, you're getting a crucial moment, you're educating in the best of ways.
You're teaching the doors.
in fact, the meaning of the word "educate" extracting "which means, to bring out what's inside, to bring the potential.
So again, what is the potential that we want to pull out?
There's been a case in the '60 in Grand brief, when they'd spend from media schools.
It's called the "evidence," We call it's "alineation in the States.
It means separate the students dependently.
And the students with the best vots have a longer program, better teachers, etc well, they've done it for a period of three months, As "" "" "" "" "" "" '""' "" ""'s good. "
And at the end of this period of three months, they were having the results at the level of "" And, of course, "And, of course, the sad of the students from" Otim. "And that's what happened at the end of three months.
Those who were stayed to school, beyond the ones I left.
The crucial part of this study was that even teachers were inganned.
The teachers didn't know it was done this change.
She was just told: These are the students from optim and these are those with ensufficient.
And so it's how they started to teach them.
So, I believe that disability is to have a damage spirit, and a damage spirit, and a damage spirit hope.
You can't see the beauty.
It has no longer our natural, infant curiosity and our innate capability to imagine.
if instead, we can support this human spirit for hope, to see the beauty, to see the beauty, if I'm imagine and in others, to be imaginative and curious force.
When the spirit has these quality, we can create new reality and new ways of being.
I'd like to leave you a poem in a persist poem of 1300 called Hafiz's called Hafigure.
and the poem is called, "The shoots who only knows four words" "" Every child known, not the God, not the NO's the God, not the NO, but God that only knows four words and keeps them, saying, "I'm going to dance with me.
Thank you.
